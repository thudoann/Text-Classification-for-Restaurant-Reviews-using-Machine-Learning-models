1	"Absolutely fantastic food , our waiter Jami was brilliant offering advice on dishes and flavours really was one of the best curry’s I’ve had , can’t wait to return"
0	"As I have taken my dinner at the restaurant 1st floor, suddenly a waiter came up and start screaming and shouting to his fellow colleague. At first, he used his own language which I would not understand. I tremendously shocked and the attitude was terrible. Seems to me they are about to fight each other. I am absolutely thundered about the behaviour. I would not come back to this restaurant. Awful experience I ever had. So, uncultured and unmanned."
0	Average food and rude service. Denied our meerkat meals for no valid reason as there is no information online and made us wait ages for a full priced bill.
1	Best curry on brick lane: the service is excellent; the food's great; and the boss man's a delight. Thoroughly recommend!
1	Best Indian I have had in a long long time. Really good menu. 30% off booking in advance. Will definitely return in near future
0	"Both me and my partner got food poisoning from our last visit. Half way through we realised the food was off. Another table who came in just after us, said the food was off also."
1	"Brilliant, friendly and generous service. Great food portions and amazing taste! Offered complimentary drinks but had to go so got a handful of extra chocolates!"
0	Chicken tikka masala wasn't nice and Sen asked us to write a review for alcohol. Serving minors... Dodgy.
1	"Delicious food, great service and incredible value for money. Like many places in Brick Lane there’s a bring-your-own-booze policy, which is fantastic."
0	"Every Indian restaurant on brick lane woo you at the door with offers of free beer or wine, a history of great reviews and celebrity endorsements. What sets The Monsoon aside is that once they sit you down they act like they don’t need your business. They were the rudest staff I have dealt with in a long time. They kept storming around the restaurant floor, the head waiter twice leaning against my table (which I hate but can forgive), they kept taking away the courses before I had finished, and by the timely came to dessert or coffee I felt rushed out the door so just paid and left. On and food was poor, with the exception of the bhaji. I will never eat there again. Brilliant restaurants just down the street that have given me excellent food and service every time."
1	"Everything was delicious and fresh, and the place has a lot of character. It was recommended to me by someone who I really trust when it comes to Indian/Bangladeshi food."
1	"Excellent food, Outstanding service and overall customer satisfaction. Me and my family of 4 visited and were treated as Kings and Queens. Quick & quality food from warm people. Also sports a vast menu which had comfortable food even for my 9 year old. Would highly recommend."
1	Exelent service sham and hes staff looked after us and had a excellent choice of curry and everything that goes with it well worth the trip from Hertfordshire and will be done again
0	"First mistake was going to Brick Lane - The hassle of the restaurant reps trying to drag you into their restaurant is not only annoying but very intrusive!Once in Monsoon the atmosphere and surroundings were pleasant enough (not flash, but not shabby either)The food at the time tasted OK, nothing spectacular but my colleagues chicken was served very over done and dry!We had a few beers and asked for the bill, which is where the fun began. Not sure if they thought we were stupid northern tourists and drunk ad they tried to over charge us by £22 - Out of order!!!Next day all 3 of us were ill (stomach craps, excessive toilet trips etc.)I don't like to criticise a persons living, but in this case avoid at all costs...Should have stuck to our regular restaurant!"
0	"Firstly, they tried to get away with just serving me very flat lemonade, despite asking twice for a vodka lemonade. Had to send it back, to the surprise of all the other happy customers around.Secondly. My curry was a joke. I ordered a tandoori special which was sweet, an absolute contrast to the description on the menu as medium heat. No curry should be luminescent orange either, until I realised they had added cheese to it! It smelt very strong of cheese and i asked the waiter about it, and he confirmed they had added cheese, which I thought was weird. I was so hungry I just ate it and I had already embarrassed my boyfriend by sending my drink back already.Thirdly, the service was terrible! They seemed to just laugh off the mistakes they had made. Anyway, the bill was 60 quid,and they had added extra dishes we didn't order to the bill. They added lower price dishes so we wouldn't notice, and again, would have loved to say something but it felt like everyone in the restaurant was staring at us for not enjoying it for some reason. I feel that the customers are either deluded or eating very different food to the ones we were served.I understand that Indian restaurants often westernise their dishes but this was too far, overpriced and I felt upset that they didn't even care. Never going back!"
0	"Food was good, owner was very nice & seemed genuine, staff wasn't great. One server didn't seem to know what he was doing. When we asked for the check, they brought us the wrong check (w no included service charge), then when they brought us the correct one 20 mins later, they added a service charge (guess they thought because we're not repeat customers as American tourists... But my boyfriend is English born & bred?!?!). Started out as a nice dinner but ended on a bad note & sadly I won't recommend."
1	"Food was incredible and the staff were lovely and considerate, and very attentive!! Very welcoming - and would recommend the butter chicken. Reasonable prices.The atmosphere was perfect, and they made it feel like a fancy dinner even though we were sat next to a group people dressed as scooby doo characters."
0	Food wasn't good and tasteless. The Chicken tikka curry was served with potatoes... Bhindi was more salty..
1	"Friendly welcome and great food. We enjoy lots of Indian meals and this was up there alongside the best. Fresh, tasty and plentiful. Highly recommended and we will be going back soon."
1	"From the warm greeting on arrival, what a lovely experience this was. While munching on a couple of popadoms, we were struggling to decide what to have for mains, as it all sounded so delicious, so we put our faith in the owner (a very nice man indeed!) to decide for us. What a good decision that was, garlic chilli chicken, which was so flavourful, and royal lamb, which was described as on-the-bone, but as I picked the bone up, every bit of meat fell off, it was so tender. Everything was delicious, the special rice, the stuffed paratha and the bhindi bhaji, but the crowning glory, was the wine, a sauvignon blanc, from INDIA. We've never tried a wine from India before, but would definitely recommend it. All in all, a fantastic meal and lovely staff, we will be back soon!"
1	Good service nice food nice staff clean and food vey hot and well presented and free drink on the house
1	Great food with good service! Food was one of the best indian food in London. 5/5! Will deffo visit again when in London.
1	Great service and great food. Special mention to Ata who gave us great service on the night. Would highly recommend!
0	Hands down the worst curry I’ve ever had. I don’t believe these 5 star reviews are legitimate. There are far better Indian food options in the area. I’m convinced the lamb was kebab meat and the naan was stale. Nice people but really awful food. Sorry.
0	"Having looked on trip adviser we decided to try this place. The food was poor quality and very over priced . Not sure where they get their prices from for so called speciality dishes that are both bland and un inspiring .I would urge people to walk past this place and try somewhere else !!"
0	"I am very angry as I am writing this. We came here to eat with family. Meal was ok, not great, way too sweet for our taste but not too bad. The problem is that they got us into the restaurant by offering us a fixed price menu, however by the time we asked for the bill they over inflated the price of our ""fixed menu"". We ordered 2 beers, 3 glasses of water and 5 poppadums on top of our menu and the price was £50 more than what they initially said. They also added service charge, which the man at the door said was already included in our deal. Avoid this place!!"
0	"I booked a table, mentioning meerkat meals and the guy said no problem. So we stuffed our faces, but they denied all knowledge of the offer and charged us full fare."
1	I booked this after getting a recommendation and I was not disappointed. Food was delicious and the service was even better. Thoroughly enjoyed myself and my mum did too as it was a birthday meal. Will definitely be back as I don’t live far away. Thanks Monsoon team!
0	"I cannot prove anything and I understand if people feel this review is conjecture, but I and my family got out of a cab, there was some confusion I believe generated by the people outside of the restaurant, and then I realised I did not have my wallet. However I am well travelled and I had my wallet to the previous 5 days without difficulty period I do not think that I lost it but that it was pilfered from me. Very unhappy with the whole experience and I would avoid this area!"
1	"I had checked out restaurants on Brick Lane in advance and this had received top scores, plus it was right next to the hotel I was staying in. I went in very late after a football match but I was promptly greater, sat down, and provided with drinks. It's hard to match the expectations I had built up from reading some of the reviews, but this was simply one of the best Indian curry experiences I have ever had. The food is unpretentious, the menu choice diverse (I'm a veggie) and in general just great. The staff were superb and enjoyed a chat. I can't remember the name of the waiter I had (apologies) but we enjoyed a good laugh as a ballsy gentleman on another table had encountered an aggressive chilli. I can't recommend this place enough, I made time for it (even at a late hour, in order to get the Brick Lane experience, before heading back to Manchester) and now I am already planning to make time for it again when I'm back in the smoke. Exceptional, thanks all."
0	"I know that it sounds weird to criticize a dish with butter in the name with being to buttery, but I have tasted enough versions of Butter Chucken to know, that this was a bad one. It tasted only like butter, and we could also see the butter separate from the rest of the sauce. My sister, who ordered the dish, could not manage to eat more than just one bite (and she is not a picky eater). Additinoally, the staff’s reaction when confronted by this, was rather a defence, than an attempt to understand why we weren’t satisfied with the dish. We felt really uncomfortable with the atmosphere in the restaurant after this. We also could not see clearly how much things cost separately when we got the bill, which was dissapointing as well. In the end, we would not recommend this restaurant at all, nor would we go to Brick Lane again, as we felt the attempts to lure us in to the different restaurants overwhelming and rather uncomfortable."
0	"I regret being enticed into this restaurant by a cheap deal. The deal was 3 beers, starter, main, rice and bread for £20 for 15 of us. Bargain if you like beer and awful Indian food! The chicken pacoras were like heated frozen chicken nuggets, the samosas were greasy and inedible, the korma was spicy and very oily with tough re-heated chicken.Seems that Brick Lane really isn't the place for good curry in London had many a bad experience down that road!"
1	I visited the amazing restaurant in a busy night last week . Despite that kind of a busy night the service from Jami was quite amazing and the dishes were lovely . Jami recommended the Royal Lamb so my wife ordered royal lamb just to amaze herself. Top class service form Jami and top class food .
1	"I visited twice in the lead up Xmas 2021 for a networking lunch and trade event friends late night snack.You are welcomed as long lost clients from the start. The owner likes to engage and the waiters love a good chat. This is a full experience of London hospitality delivered consistently.The food is traditional uk high street Bangladeshi food but cooked to perfection. Each dish is cooked in its own sauce and have distinctively deficient globalise and textures. Well deserving to be in Tripadvisor top 100 restaurants in London."
0	"I went to the restaurant the other day. One fo the workers assumed I wasn't a bengali speaker, decided to speak about myself and my friend in a bad manner. After I told his fellow worker about this, he thought it wasn't much of an issue and told us 'eat or leave'. I would never consider eating here again!!"
1	"I went to the restaurant today, because I was searching for a nice looking location, which is not too expensive. They opened the door for me and lead me to my table. The staff recommend me some dishes, because I didn’t had a clue about Indian food. They helped me and I got the right food for my taste. I fell in love! The food was fresh, so incredibly tasty and the atmosphere was amazing. I will come back"
1	"I went to this fabulous restaurant with 3 friends. We had the best time ever. The food was delicious, we received the best service. Great value for money. I will be back as soon as I am in the area! Thank you !!"
0	"It was suggested by a cabbie for late night dinner. It was a horrid experience. At 01:10 am we were told that they are open till 02:30 am. After entering & being seated, the same staff tells us they are closed & offered takeaway.I however placed a large 'lucrative' order with drinks, but while waiting I noticed they were turning away people similarly.No point writing excessively on poor service - having to ask for ice for my scotch repeatedly till dinner was placed.No ice for drink even while food went cold.But, leave alone the service ( I'm sure staff wanted to get home)- the reason I advise, not to eat here is becos the food seemed 'recycled' !!!And I paid £42 for cold reheated old food."
0	"It’s an unhygienic and crap restaurant ever I have seen. I sat down inside the restaurant around 10pm with my wife to celebrate her birthday. Suddenly I saw an aged member of staff took the pickle tray from other table and shifting bits and bobs from those used tray and make another one to prepare for others . I felt sick that I was been served same. I do not recommend this place at all.Please make yourself away!!"
1	Just had dinner at monsoon with 2 friends. The food was great and so was the service. 10/10 real indian experience. Next time i’m in london i’ll go to monsoon again!
0	"Like many others, we came here partly because of the positive reviews here. But also, the man outside trying to get our custom offered us things that turned out not to be true. He promised us a private room on the top floor (we were a party of 16 for a birthday) where we would have control of our own music.When we eventually got up to the top floor (after a long wait) there were other tables with customers and we couldn't use our own music. Add to this the fact that it was incredibly noisy from a loud downstairs room and that they also didn't set enough places at the table for us. I would have left but it was already late and didn't want to drag everyone back out to find another restaurant, but basically we were lied to and it left a sour taste.After we sat it took a long time to get our orders in, and we'd been sat for an hour before our starters arrived. The food itself was - being generous - average.So all in all, dishonest staff, bad service, below average food and a bad environment in general (including toilets in a very bad way).Save yourself the stress and stay away."
0	Looked busy so decided must be ok. Offered free first beer so good start. However palik paneer was inedible sweet coconut ?? - chicken was bland but made hot with chilli and lamb was ok. Service variable and not very friendly - would not return
1	"Love this place have been coming for years. Always a good place to catch up with friends or to go with the Mrs Amazing food, great service and well priced Always worth popping down"
1	"Loved the place from the environment to the food, everything was lovely. Staff were very nice and friendly and the food was delicious. Definitely recommend it!"
1	"Lovely food great company, really enjoyed my time at this curry house, the staff were very accommodating"
1	Nice staff clean tables drink on the house nice food served hot very friendly and always make sure everything is fine
0	"Offered free drinks by staff outside which we never got. We felt rushed from the minute we got in there as it’s clearly a high turnover restaurant. Served exceptionally fast on both courses, no sooner had the plates been taken away and the next course arrived. Meal was mediocre. When I asked for a second beer it was closely followed by the bill which I hadn’t asked for. No offer of dessert. They clearly wanted our table again to get more through. Disappointing Brick Lame experience. I’ll try somewhere else next time."
0	"Onion bhajiya and Chicken Tikka - To be very honest, the quantity was very little (which is good as the taste was not worth to order more) . These starters gave an impression that someone is learning to cook"
1	"Our meal was delicious! Great food, wonderful service, loved it. We’ll be back! Order the prawn tandoori dish, really tasty"
1	Out of all Indian restaurants in bricklane The Monsoon is by far the best. 10/10 food never let down and a friendly customer service always taking care of its customers :)
1	Quick service. Food tasted amazing. Girlfriend agrees. We both cleaned our plates. Would definitely come again.
1	"Quite possibly the best lamb roghan josh we have ever had. Great meal, excellent service and spot on pricing. Highly recommended."
1	Really delicious food with lots of spice and flavour. Super friendly and helpful staff who may or may not have encouraged me to leave this review. Would go again.
1	Really enjoyed the food with lots of choices and all reasonably priced food. Would defo come again ! :)
1	"Really nice food, impeccable service, really friendly waiters and especially the manager who introduced me and my son to lots of delicious food"
0	Rubbish curry made from cheap ingredients which were brought in by the staff from the shop around the corner throughout our meal in plastic carrier bags. We ordered two very different curries for main course but they were in the same tomato-based sauce. Bottled beer not properly chilled. Attentive staff and clean surroundings but it's easy to get better food elsewhere.
0	"the food is tastless, portion sizes are extremely small given the price being paid. dont be fooled even if they offer you free drinks or 20% discount the place is really really bad!!"
1	"The food was amazing, service amazing, huge recommend. I would come back here in an instant. You should check this out!"
1	The food was great and really great decor inside. I was really impressed by the art on the walls and there was great banter from the staff and owner. Would recommend to friends and family.
1	The food was lovely and the staff very so friendly and made us feel right at home. Thanks so much! Definitely will be back again.
0	"The Monsoon seems to typify the peculiarly British, and particularly London, approach to food - any old rubbish will do, any attempt at authenticity isn't worth the candle, and if you're a tourist you're fair game. Here's a radical idea for the owners - forget about employing touts outside, focus on improving the cooking instead, and people will throw themselves in the door. As it is, people would be better off going to Tesco and buying a ready meal."
0	"The people outside persuade you to come and have food there by saying that they will give you free drinks and a surprise as it was our friend's birthday. To my surprise, when we asked for it. They simply denied us and told us that you should not trust the guy representing our restaurant outside.This is not acceptable from their end. How can they put up a person that gives false claims and tries bribing customers here ?!Also the food was not good. The service was terrible and so was the staff."
0	The service was kind okay but the food was shockingly bad and I have wonder why so many people reviewed this place positively…
1	The staff were very friendly and the service was great. The food was very tasty and the saag paneer was a highlight for me!
1	This food was amazing quality along with the service I would highly recommend this place to anyone that likes Indian food I can’t rate it any more higher
1	"This is the second time I have been to this place. I went a few months ago with a colleague…and the waiter even remembered me!!The food was lovely and the service brilliant! The staff are very friendly and nice. Reasonably priced food and drinks! Thoroughly recommend!!"
0	"This was a Xmas party event. 20+ people had pre booked our orders weeks ago. Table booked for 7pm. Got there for 7pm. By 8.30pm we still hadn't received our starters and only had 1 drink. We complained. The waiter went from being our best friend to swearing at us and walking out. ( later that evening management told him to go home, rumour was he was sacked lol) nearly 2 hours later they start to bring starters and main meals together. Chaos erupted. Mains brought before starters. Rice and bread brought but by the time main came the rice and nan was cold. After 3 hours a few people still hadn't received their food!!!! Meal was already booked and paid for so we couldn't walk out. They already had over £500+ of our money!. It got so late we had to walk out without even desserts coming. As I said a few people never got any food served after 3 hours so left.This may have good reviews by others but it seems the busier they are the more chance they fall to pieces and can not cope. All of us will not be returning or recommending this place to anyone."
0	"This was my first Brick Lane experience and I was really looking forward to an authentic curry experience. Well if you want mediocre, overcooked, lukewarm food then that is what you will get. Nothing tastec like it was freshly cooked but tasted rehested and even the naan bread was soggy. The service was appalling, the food overpriced and sadly disappointing. IF this is the best in Brick Lane I will not be back. The restaurant is benefitting from the renowned reputation of Brick Lane but does not live up to the hype. I can truly say it is the worst curry I have ever had."
0	"Too expensive not upto the mark, the the tandoori items were literally raw, they charged us for the lime in our coke. Their Chicken Nawabi was tasty but the potion was miserable."
0	"Took ages to get served, the wrong curry arrived and my rice never arrived despite asking for it multiple times. The staff treat you like you're an inconvenience when you speak to them and that's if you're fortunate enough to attract anyone's attention. I wouldn't come back here."
1	very good food and very polite and very friendly people and love the service and how the food was well cooked
1	Very tasty food especially the tandoori chicken. All the dishes you would expect plus an excellent selection of fish curries.
1	Visited Monsoon on Friday 19th November with friends during a short break into the smoke. We all enjoyed the food immensely. Very attentive staff and happy to cook food not included on the menu. We will definitely be back even though Dover is a long way away.
1	"Visited on 6th September whilst on a mini break to London. I can honestly say this is the best Indian restaurant I've visited for 25 years. Food was superb, service excellent and cleanliness was spot on. Would not hesitate to return or recommend."
1	Visited on Sunday evening. Great atmosphere. Very good food. Excellent service. Staff were all very pleasant.
0	"We ate here based on the trip advisor reviews but can't understand how they are so good. The food was absolutely terrible, starters raw in the middle, rice lukewarm, main courses tasted of uncooked curry powder. We are not at all fussy and love Indian food but actually couldn't eat several of the dishes. We were the only people in the restaurant so probably should have taken that as a warning and gone elsewhere."
1	"We ate here last night after a film, the food was great and prices reasonable. Better still, I accidentally ordered a biryani with chicken in it (I'm a vegetarian) and they took it back and changed it for a veggie biryani without charging me for it, even though it was totally my fault. That's classy. They also wouldn't take any service charge...Would definitely come again!"
0	"We booked several weeks in advance for a 7:45 dinner for 19 people. The restaurant called the day before to confirm, which was promising. However, on the night we were not seated until 8:15 and most of our party had to wait outside in the cold for half an hour. We were kindly offered a round of free drinks because of this.When we were finally taken to our table on the 2nd floor, the waiters were still throwing tables, chairs, and tablecloths around. Napkins and cutlery were pretty much dropped onto us a few minutes later. After some time we were told we would also be given complimentary popadoms for the long wait to order drinks. We did eventually order our drinks, but food orders were a long time coming.Our food arrived around 10:30 (almost 3 hours after our reservation time). One end of the table received piping hot food and finished their meal before the other end of the table was served. I was one of the later people to be given food and it was tolerably warm, but definitely not hot. As well, the process by which we were given our plates was very chaotic. There was a lot of shouting dish names, as well as disgruntled waiters when they brought out food we had not ordered. Additional beer, water, and soft drinks were also hard to come by. In one instance I tried to ask for a glass of water for a friend (who had requested a glass 10 minutes earlier), but the waiter simply carried on drying cutlery behind me.In the end, we were charged for the popadoms and the waiter and manager refused to accept that the service we received was quite bad."
0	"We booked well in advance for a group of 18 work colleagues to finish off a gathering for Xmas.On arrival we were made to wait 20 minutes in the main entrance and amongst people who were already eating. I don't know what they must have thought.Whilst waiting we could hear an extremely group roudy and load on the middle floor.. which turned out to be a group of half naked young men action like idiots.The restaurant tries to seat us on the top floor where there was clearly no room for our party so we left without even trying the food.Clearly very busy so food must be OK but appalling service soon as we have booked at least a month in advance.Their loss as another restaurant further up Brick Lane quickly made room for us and gave exceptional service and food."
1	We inadvertently discovered this restaurant and what a delight. Excellent service and great food - no complaints from our party of four. Thoroughly recommend and will return.
0	We just made ourselves a promise to NEVER EVER return to the crooks on Brick Lane.
0	"We ordered Matar Paneer and Chicken Tikka Balti from Uber Eats. Food was so terrible, If someone understands the authenticity of Indian Food and how it should be made, they will understand the terrible quality of this restaurant.1-Matar Paneer was totally sweet, I would suggest they should move Matar Panner from Vegetarian Main course to Desserts. Terrible taste and Quality !!2-Chicken Tikka Balti was too oily- It was like chef used all the available oil reserve restaurant had. Tasteless and pathetic food.I even called the restaurant complaining about the food quality but was given very rude reply from restaurant.I would not recommend this restaurant at all. This might be the Worst food in London."
1	"We visited during early November21. The staff were very friendly, especially with our kid. The atmosphere was quiet, but it was early evening. The food was really good. Vindaloo was extremely tasty and the portion was excellent (I was full, which is rare). My Four Year Old's first Indian food and he's keen to go back :)"
0	"We visited to the restaurant today evening. We were so attracted on the review of trip advisor. But the food quality was ripped off. They influenced and bribe to seek a good review from all curry fan with free shots such as sambuca etc. We were not exceptional. It’s awful and predominantly cheating with us. Food were hackneyed and compare with other curry house it’s rubbish.So, I recommend to everyone please don’t give attention to them and find others in Bricklane.Hopefully it will help you out."
0	"We went to The Monsoon last night as it has got so many good recent reviews on TripAdvisor. We ordered onion bhaji and samosas which were tasteless and I was hoping the main course to be better however the three dishes we ordered tasted exactly the same although they should really have their individual taste according to the menu. My fish dish which cost £14.50 was dry and clearly they used some sort of frozen fish which is not a big deal, however mid-way through I hit a piece of fish that tasted very sicky and unpleasant that I had to spit it out and stopped eating!This makes me wonder how this restaurant got so many good reviews since it serves probably the worst Indian food ever? Anyway, never again and I would really recommend to avoid this place if you want to have a nice meal."
0	"We were absolutely appalled after visiting the monsoon. In particular, they attempted to significantly over charge us without us knowing. I would strongly advise that people avoid this place. If you must go be very careful as it could end up costing much more than you think."
0	"We were encouraged to visit based on the largely outstanding reviews. The food was frankly awful - my starter of chicken tikka pakora was sponge-like and devoid of flavour. The curries were greasier than any I've ever had.The bathrooms were a health hazard - not helped by the large raucous party downstairs that had been allowed to play thumping bass so loud that we couldn't hear ourselves talk.On closer inspection, the positive reviews seem to be largely from reviewers with only one review to their names. Sort it out Tripadvisor,"
0	"We were excited to have authentic Indian on brick lane with good reviews and a gluten free option. The waiters were so rude, sloppy, when we asked questions about the menu they hurried us , changed the answer 3 times and didn't even care about anything. We had to ask for the bill 3 times. One curry was okay, the other one nutter chicken tasted fake and chemical like, very cheap ingredients obviously. There wasn't that many in the restaurant but they were still rude and hurried. We won't be going back here, save yourself the hassle!"
0	"We were greeted with a promise of complimentary drink, then the wine list was taken away, we could only have house fraught beer, house wines...had to get our own menus as waited for 15 mins for them, ordered food and starters were almost thrown on the table, and my prawn puri tasted chemically. Ordered more beers but bottled as fraught was warm and wrank, bottles turned up and they were fresh out if fridge and still warm. Then mains turned, was told to move glasses and bottles so waiter could throw down our dishes, The madras was worst I ever had, Pathia and dansak ere just average but coated in chilli powder to disguise the cheap cuts of chicken. Also found it over priced...I never leave a restaurant without leaving a tip, but on this occasion I never felt it warranted one."
0	"We were planning on eating here tonight but as we passed going back to our hotel room the guy outside who was touting for business said something to his colleague in a foreign language about my wife which she did not understand, and then started clapping. Compliment or otherwise my wife was ultimately put off by their rude behaviour so we ate elsewhere and will not be returning. A little bit of respect, especially for the ladies may help. A shame because we were looking forward to eating here as it has decent reviews for the quality of food. Shame about the staff that tout for business, and you really should conduct yourselves better and really shouldn't have to tout for business."
0	"Went as a large group on a Friday night. We were put on the top floor, out of the way and away from any atmosphere.Food took ages to arrive, but my lamb rogan josh tasted absolutely fine when it came. Only problem was when I got home several hours later I was violently ill out of both ends. Was very ill for about two days with nasty food poisoning and not quite right for a week after that.You can bring your own booze, but having lost a week to illness I would not recommend. There are loads of other curry houses on Brick Lane - go somewhere else instead."
0	"Went here because of the reviews, food was decent, but when the bill came I saw 4.80 gbp for 1.5l of water. That they overprice water is one thing, quite common too, but almost 5 gbp?! Insane. Won't come back"
1	"Went to the local pub to ask for a recommendation (and a pint of course) and was told to come here.Wasn’t disappointed and really enjoyed the food.Recently I’ve not bothered with rice, and have found a Naan bread and curry enough, and that was the case here. Garlic naan was hot, fresh, doughy in the middle and crisp on the outside and smothered in garlic. Could have enjoyed it as a meal on its own.Had tandoori chicken masala that was just the right heat and plenty of sauce for dipping into. My wife did have rice and a house special curry. What I tasted of both were just as good and probably a bit more complex flavour and ingredients.We didn’t push the boat out but did have a couple of drinks and the whole thing came to well under £50 for two great curries and a few sides ( we did have the compulsory popadoms and pickles).Can’t compare with the other options on Brick Lane but really enjoyed this and the staff were friendly and helpful too."
0	"What a clever ploy this establishment operates. Young man outside The Monsoon directs you to view the trip advisor screen displayed in their window which shows the very high position this restaurant holds in the rankings of restaurants in London. So on that basis we enter after all at this point we don’t have any suspicions about the place. We ordered poppadoms cauliflower bhaji, onion bhaji, chicken biryani, chicken chat. It was all very bland without any of the subtle flavours of a real Indian/Bangladeshi dish. The onion bhaji was tepid and flat and hadn’t had long enough in the microwave oven. The biryani came with what the waiter called “gravy”. For more than 40 years I have been served a vegetable curry with a biryani not a tasteless dhal. I had to check out the reviews once I had got home and it was curious that so many 5 stars came from first time reviewers. I won’t return here."
1	"While visiting London and staying in Brick Lane, we checked into our hotel in the early hours of the morning. We saw that The Monsoon was open so headed in for a meal. They had closed for the evening but cooked us a meal for us to take away . While waiting, we were able to have a drink. As we were in a hotel room, we had no cutlery or bowls to use, so staff sorted us some plastic cutlery and two plastic take away pots for us to use as bowls. They even threw in a bottle of Cobra. They couldn't have been more helpful, in the early hours of the morning, to make sure we could eat, especially as they were probably about to head home themselves...thankyou."
0	"Whilst the waiter was clearing the table he knocked my phone off the table which smashed the screen. When I told him he initially laughed and said it wasn't his fault. I asked for the manager who, after a long chat, agreed to pay to fix my phone. However he refused to pay for it then and instead insisted on meeting me at the Apple Store the following week. Despite this being hugely inconvenient seeing as I live miles away, I had no choice but to agree. However (surprise surprise) the manager is now not responding to any of my messages when I have tried to arrange this.Another thing to put the cherry on the cake with our experience was the fact that my friend who doesn't eat meat, had meat put in his dish."
1	"Wonderful service, excellent food, lovely staff!!! We have been been to several Indian restaurants on brick lane and this is by the far the the BEST!!! Will be back again soon!"
0	"Yes, the previous feedback are absolutely right. They always do this things. All member of staff doing exactly same. They bribe with all fascinating deal outside and indoors they poke to get a false review!! Ohh!! Full of crap.."
0	Who wants to pay full price to eat from a couple of salad bowls that the rest have as appetizer? It's just an insult and a sign of ignorance to think that vegetarians only eat salad. This was the last time I'll try to go there. I'm sad
1	Awesome ambience!!! Nice variety of dishes !!! Taste of the food was fantabulous..Hats off to the Chefs and all those involved in making the exoerience wonderful
1	"The best place in Vegas for breakfast (just check out a Sat, or Sun."
1	Great service. Computerised order screen make it really easy. Order on the screen and just sit down..and they bring you your food to the table...yes I did say they bring you your food. This was faster than going to any drive in that I have visited before.
1	"Good food, good value, good service - happy with the experience!"
0	If you have a vegan in your group I would recommend you to find another place. The service is slow and it it is also a bit expensive
0	"And thats’s bad! Stay away. Don’t even try. Bad pasta, bad pizza, bad seashell. Within ten minutes after ordering all our food was served. Dishes looked like a womit. Pizza was probably from the freezer. Not even our kids could eat it."
0	"We went to a tango show on a Sunday night (10 pm). Food was vile (hamburgers, ham sandwich and lomo sandwich)- I’ve had better at McDonalds. The tango show managed to take all of the passion out of tango. I don’t understand why people line up to get into this place. Stay away."
1	"Great burgers. I heard some pretty bad press about this place, but everything from food to staff and interior was more than good enough."
0	Decor great cats lovely. Food and organisation poor. At the end of the day I spent £70 to eat a poor tea and pet a cat.
0	We ordered two croque monsieurs and one chicken and bacon baguette. The baguette tasted fine but the croque monsieurs ordered were absolutely horrible.
1	"World class food, drinks, service and ambiance. If you are looking for classic Mughlai cusine, go elsewhere. If you're looking for interesting takes on Indian cuisine this place does it right."
0	"Had been my motorcycle destination for years but time to find a new place. Stopped by today and was really busy as always (not the reason for the rating) the beers were warm and the service was cold. Host at the front told us to sit any where in the bar area, we took one of the two unoccupied smaller tables and told by a server we had to go up front and ask if we could sit there, but could sit at the bar, as someone was leaving I tried to swoop up the available chairs only to be told they were reserved. Can't win here, beer was warm and didn't bother to get anything to eat. The two tables remained unoccupied the entire time I was there."
1	"Our group came for the meatballs, but we were impressed by the superb service and overall experience. The meatballs were good, but I preferred the delicious fresh flounder entree. Great beer and wine selection, and also an extensive choice of aquavit options. Highly recommend."
0	When I commented on it they apologized very rude and let my pay the full price anyway. Very poor service.
1	We had such a wonderful evening at this restaurant. The food was tasty and host excellent fun. A unique and intimate experience!
0	Awful food. Mediocre service. A very strange mixture of flavours which just did not work. Stay away from the sardines and watermelon.. they were seriously nauseating. We had to cover the dish with a napkin because of its appearance. Don't waste your time or money.
0	"Since when does a chain facility in a busy tourist area run out of key food items? No crepes and no tea. Since that is why I came here, I left hungry. I'll add that and unorganized, slow staff didn't help the situation any."
0	AWFUL HORRIBLE WOMAN RUNNING do not visit. I had a cheeseburger and it was virtually inedible. Do not go!! You risk your life and I have reported this to health officials. Also got shouted at for not ordering within 5 seconds
1	Nice and cosy place with much more than just pizza on the menu.
1	We were looking for a dinner with gluten free option for one of us. Some of my friends tried local course and I the pizza. All the opinion were ok. The Pizza made by AN italian pizzaiolo with ingredienti from Naples was really good.
0	"Genuinely surprised to be writing a negative review, because we had heard good things about this place.It turned out to be a fairly disappointing experience. The appetizers were passable, but the main courses were just bad; the teriyaki duck was dry and tasted only of frying batter, and the Mongolian chicken was greasy and buried in garlic sauce to the point that all the other flavours ceased to exist.Felt like a waste of cash."
1	"Really nice experience, food is super tasty, nice vibe and cozy atmosphere. Best salmon I had on my visit in Dubai ! Must try ! Need to mention fast and friendly service. Definitely worth to go!"
1	Perfect service and exceptional quality of the food. I can recommend this place as it is well worth visiting. We will return in the near future for sure.
1	Delicious smashed avocado poached egg and bacon and vegan full english. If anything we just wished we’d had more! Pancakes next time too!
0	"The worse food, I would ever had."
0	The food was not anywhere near authentic Japanese ramen. The noodle soup I order was made with minced meat (with fat in it). It was barely edible. It was definitely the worst restaurant I've ever had in Paris and many places I've been to.
0	Typical rope a dope guys on the street to pull people in because they do not have enough return customers. Easy to get a reservation on a Friday night another clue of what a crap place. The outside approach had me worried on the way it looks. I thought hey it looks bad it must be authentically good. I was wrong. Overly greasy and sweet dishes.
0	Was told this place was 3rd on the best places to eat so had to try. Being a regular at RUDYS in ancoats and I find rudys far better. The pizza was very nice here. But not traditional Neapolitan. And how can it when a guy from Rome is making the pizza. Woke the next day to find it lay very heavy on me. Having said that it did taste nice. But from now on I will stick to Rudys.
1	Had a winter lunch with a great view over the sea. Service super friendly and nice. Food (chicken) cooked to perfection. Will go again.
0	"Who can resist the huge kanelbulle or cinnamon rolls stacked up by the window? We went in, and it was more about the size and the fun than the taste. The cinnamon roll was dense, a bit dry, and too sweet for my taste. We barely ate a quarter of it."
1	"5 stars for fresh & nice bagels, for their famous gigantic kannelbullar:) and the highly cosy atmosphere, especially when raining :) A place where locals are used to go, we fully understand them !"
1	"Absolutly, amazing food. Traditional, fresh, tasty, good portion. Good service.The decor will make you feel as you moved within time. One of the first and oldest Emiraty restaurant. There is one more in archaeology side.Truly recommend"
0	"The staff look absolutely worked off and tired, which showed as the food was mediocre compared to other Nandos I've been to. One of the staff, a blonde male was also incredibly patronising in his tone and rude to us too when we asked a question about a menu item."
1	"My peanut allergic daughter ate her with my brother for her Christmas present.  They had the per-theater special which included an appetizer, main dish and dessert.  They make everything in house so she could have the bread and dessert (homemade ice cream).  My brother and daughter were very impressed about their knowledge and care about food allergies.  (hint: you have to ask for the per-theater special)."
1	great brunch spot in vegas. food portions are huge and so many delicious options. bloody marys are yum! must do when in vegas
1	"Visiting from Melbourne, Australia, family took me out for dinner!For a NYC steakhouse, Club A Steakhouse is Excellent. The service is impeccable.The meal was amazing, great ambiance in the restaurant and very good waitstaff.I will definitely be back to this elegant place with great atmosphere, food and staff, every time I'm in NYC, to experience again, one of the most pleasant dinner evenings I've ever had.I hope Mr. Bruno and his amazing team, continue to successfully provide, countless pleasant dining experiences to all of us, for many decades to come."
0	Ordered the chili burger and specifically asked for it to be vegetarian. Haven't eaten meat for the last ten years and got bacon on my burger !! Under all criticism!
1	Our driver suggested breakfast here and we loved our meal. Everything was prepared so well. The food was delicious and carried us through lunch. Our server was Jamie and she was outstanding. Don’t miss out on this place.
1	"Fresh food, great taste and friendly staff! You have to try their drinks, butterscotch whiskey sour is a new favourite!"
0	Food was not great. 6 course taster menu is a joke. Did not like the experience at all. Hugely disappointed. Not going to return
0	"We went for dinner close to the hotel because we were hungry and the kids were fussy. Big mistake. Food took over 1.5 hours to arrive. Service was terrible so ruined the experience. They did not offer any concessions due to their delays. Food was average. Would not recommend, many other options available on the strip."
0	The lamb tikka starter was very overcooked. The chicken tikka masala was definetly chicken korma. I paid my £10 and left. Avoid!
0	The waitress was very dismissive of my son’s allergies. When I asked if she could cut up a potatoe and bake it so it was like steak fries she said “I’m not sure it’s really busy back there”. Not something any allergy mom/dad or person wants to hear. Won’t be going back!
0	Having read such fantastic reviews we were disappointed.... The food was average and were reminded at least twice during our two hour stay that we only had the table for two hours. The staff then cheekily queried why we hadn't left their suggested 10% tip when we had left about 6%. We were squashed in and it was not an enjoyable evening. Won't be returning.
0	No waitress service and limited seating. The breakfast menu is limited but the prices are good for New York The food was average at best. The potatoes were mushy and had too many peppers and the bacon was greasy and undercooked. Not returning
0	This ain't nordic food.
1	Visited the tea house after a recommendation from a friend in Dubai. I have to say it was one of our best meals in our 10 day stay!
0	"Disappointing tbh. Maybe I have high standards for Israeli food but no single dish screamed out at me and we ordered 6. Service was slow though ambience and location nice. The ox cheek is horrendously pongy which put me off the whole experience tbh. Hummous was raved about but lacked anything exciting. Mackerel, was super tiny I though it was a let down. Dishes looked great but at times it felt ingredients were used uneccessrily and more for the look than any form of texture or taste. Only good thing was bread. I wouldn't reccomend."
0	"Buffet spread is not organised, people get confused searching for items, no cut fruits in buffet dinner, thats a surprise. Just a single starters, taste is average. Visiting after 4 years, still no improvement in taste. But for sure they have to change the buffet layout. Not in line with Grand Chola brand."
1	"An excellent experience overall - atmosphere, service and food. I found the atmosphere to be casual and not at all stuffy, The staff was very attentive, but not at all intrusive, and the food was excellent."
1	"Great spot! My son who is allergic to Peanuts, Tree Nuts, Eggs, and Fish was able to safely eat cupcakes, cookies, and brownies. He absolutely loved the red velvet cupcake! Can’t wait to get back here for more!"
0	Salad was so rotted I had to throw it away or risk food poisoning.
1	It’s my 3rd time at bazlama ..Very delicious breakfast  and as well as the price is really cheap .. highly recommended .
1	"The Munchner Stubn is a very traditional German restaurant, so if you like meat and beer, you have come to the right place."
0	10€ for a small beer and 4€ for a small coke!!!! That says all just skip the hole island it´s just a crappy place with lots of tourist traps.Go to some other greek island.
1	Really good service and the Tariq is been amazing the way he make customers happy it’s amazing very positive
0	The food there was cold and tasted so bad! Nothing worse than cold fried food.
1	"My favourite place in Hong Kong for Peking Duck. I have never been disappointed in 15 years. Fabulous dishes such as beggar chicken or dim sum (xiaolongbao) are a must. Decoration is Chinese chic. There is sufficient space between the tables so that it does not feel overcrowded or too noisy, even with large group tables.The service is polite and efficient. Can’t wait to visit again."
1	"I went with my friends it was amazing vibes ,great service and exceptional food experience. Specially Head chef amit came to greet us on table and explained tasting menu and ingredients. Restaurant manager Razu paired wine for our tasting menu and Cocktails were great too. All the staff are very professionally and helpful. Definitely come back soon and recommend to food lovers"
0	It was just horrendous. We ordered from the set menu simply because it had what we would've ordered off the main a la carte menu and it was a better value to order the special. WRONG. It was disgraceful. The Caesar salad was drowned in sauce so was not good at all. Then the rump steak I was served was burnt special. WRONG. It was disgraceful. The Caesar salad was drowned in sauce so was not good at all. Then the rump steak I was served was burnt
0	Strongly unrecommended!
0	Service seems to be very disconnected. Kleftico was cold. Overall very disappointing.
1	"What a wonderful afternoon spent in this amazing restaurant. We all had the Ribeye, so tender and full of flavour! Great wine and food selection, and service was very tentative. My friends and I want to make this gorgeous restaurant our place for lunch once a month. 5 stars"
1	"I love this place, they have a nice selection of wine and the server Amanda is really nice and friendly."
0	"We went here with high hopes after hearing lots of good reviews. However, unfortunately as the title indicates, the cocktails looked good but tasted far too sweet and were ultimately very disappointing. We might have made unlucky choices but ultimately the overall ambiance felt a bit dingy and we would not go back."
1	Easily one of my to-go restaurants that have been visited many times. Try it out!
0	"You wait long enough to get to your table, the service is bad and rude, not according to the type of restaurant. The facility is gorgeous and beautiful. And same thing nobody speaks english"
1	This restaurant was a great find can’t believe we hadn’t been before ! Great food and great service. Will definitely recommend it was so great to have the choice of an outside table.
1	"Only thing better than the carefully crafted drinks, phenomenal service, and the food were the views of London while we ate our celebratory dinner, which Duck & Waffle were so kind to provide a small congratulatory dessert bite 😊... We'd recommend to any friends visiting London from out of town."
1	"We had the fortune of stumbling across this restaurant in Cannes yesterday and it was delightful. The staff were very smart in their uniforms; very friendly and very efficient. Service was very quick. It’s testament to the restaurant’s’ popularity that it was so full. The atmosphere was very good too, and the whole ambience led to us thoroughly enjoying our meal. The lunch for two of us came to about 70 Euro’s. The restaurant is exactly opposite the main exhibition centre on the Croisette Boulevard. "
0	"Dirty restaurant. There is mold on the walls. the person who attends is extremely rude, treats us very badly the food is bad. nothing is worth it"
0	"Stopped for a quick coffee after wandering through Haga district, high expectations after reading reviews. Sadly the filter coffee was average, tables rather grubby and doesn't live up to reviews. "
0	The food just look horrible; the pad Thai doesn't look good at all
1	"What an excellent night!!! Food is amazing, service is outstanding, wine selection is great (with surprisingly good Israeli wine). We had prawns, cauliflower steak, aubergine mess, chicken and artichoke. The food presentation is awesome, extremely tasty. Highly recommend. Will be coming back certainly!! Please do visit!!"
1	"It was a great dining experience from the warm and welcoming staff and the food. The clam chowder, sea bass with spinach and lobster ravioli was delicious! This place is well worth the money"
0	Food is not bad but service is awful I can’t understand this restaurant reputation is good It’s awful
1	We booked in advance for our anniversary breakfast and was glad we did as this place gets very busy. We sat outside with the heaters and it was perfect. Our server was delightful and gave us good tips about our drinks (we had a carafe of St Germain spritz and it was delicious. We were recommended the bacon and after seeing it walking through knew it was going to be good. We also ordered the goats cheese omelet and corn beef hash. The food was soooo tasty and of great quality. The portion size was huge and well worth the money. We were treated to a pastry choc bun for our anniversary which was such a lovely touch. This place is a must when in vegas!
0	"I have just had the misfortune to visit this restaurant. I had heard mixed reviews but thought it might be worth a try. How wrong was I? My wife had the salmon and it was terrible and as for the pea veloute, it was brown and lumpy. Not a pleasant experience. How can they not get these simple dishes right?"
1	Was amazing this experience! Hot and crunchy fish and so fresh!! The burger was perfect too.. simple but delicious
0	"I went into this restaurant with HIGH expectations, because I saw online that it received good reviews from diners. Unfortunately I've had a better experience at McDonalds or Costa Coffee."
1	Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.
0	This is a beautiful restaurant that should be avoided. The food was poorly prepared and the service was lacking. I should have looked at Trip Advisor before going as I now see that many people have had similar experiences. There are so many fine eateries nearby that there is no reason to waste your time or money on his one. Overpriced and under delivered.
1	"Fantastic!!! Utterly fabulous food, service, atmosphere, wine list, views"
1	"What delectable food! The spaghetti is the best I've ever had; it's creamy and delicious, with just the proper amount of bacon. And we ordered a lot of delicious food, which we all devoured! If you're looking for a place to eat, you won't be disappointed with this establishment! The staff was really kind and welcoming!"
0	Many of the dishes are real showstoppers
1	"Perfect Surrounding, fantastic Food and Perfect Service . Taking care a lot of us, but Not disturbing the atmosphere.. Food was very authentic "
0	"Vinegarry wine, bored looking staff, and all the fresh energy of an overstuffed victorian teahouse. This was definitely a disappointment."
0	"This is arguably worst meal I have eaten in my life. I would not give that food to a dog,  1 star is way over of what they really deserve. Absolute garbage."
1	One of the best sushi restaurants in Seattle! Sashimi itself was high quality and pretty close to the ones you get in Japan!
1	The service was excellent and Mr. Chef provided a beautiful dessert which we really enjoyed and really appreciated everything you provided!
1	Had a couple of drinks and a dessert here. Nice bar to sit outsode if wheather allows! Would be glad to come back here next time.
1	This was the best Indian I was ever eaten at. The chicken korma and butter chicken were the best. Very good service by Mr Ali!
1	Very much enjoyed my lunch here- excellent food and Joy was a great and friendly server. I will come again in the future.
0	The taste is disappointing. ..
1	The oldest Bar Notable In Buenos Aires did not disappoint! A fun tango show with drinks was a great part of sharing the city’s passion with my family.
1	"If there is a queue of people waiting to get in don't be tempted to walk away, join the queue and wait to enjoy the delicious food and atmosphere."
1	"A brilliant restaurant in the sky! The staff are courteous and friendly, the food is weird and wonderful!! Try it, you'll LOVE it!!"
0	Strange set up with average cocktails to start. Then really average unseasoned food. The chicken was pretty cooked and came out very hard. The tomatoes were peeled on the tomato salad and soggy. The beef rib was really dry and whilst I realise this has to be pre cooked but it was old and dry at the table. Shame.
1	This place is a gem. The best atmosphere in Bangkok. The most delicious Thai food in the city. The service is fantastic. The staff makes you feel so welcome here. We liked it so much that we came back for dinner the next night and tried their amazing desserts!
0	Atmosphere is good. However the food wasn't very good. If you want to try make sure you don't seat out side. My sister had a bird poo on top of her head... lol
1	"My husband and I went here for lunch. I had the chilled seafood platter, he had garlic breaded salmon over risotto. Everything was absolutely delicious! The lobster and jumbo lump crab were so fresh and fantastic it was like being in seafood Heaven ( lol). We paired out meal with some Champagne and Prosecco which was a perfect compliment. The waiter was extremely attentive and helpful. The interior is clean and very updated. I highly recommend this restaurant for seafood lovers!"
1	"We tried the Sunday Lunch option at Fire Lake, the food was fantastic and for an amazing price of 125AED. Our servers were brilliant, espescially David. We will definitely return and would recommend everyone to give it a try!"
1	"This is the 3rd time I have dined here,Each time the food and the service have been excellent, not to mention the ambiance."
1	They were delicious- cake like cookie with a sugary icing. Ice Tea was delicious. Wait staff was helpful. Nice for take out.
1	"The food was great, superb presentation, the service was fantastic. Highly recommended!"
1	Great service. Great food and ambiance excellent
0	"Terrible service expensive food,  do not order smashed potatoes. They are GROSS! Nothing was good there!!!!!"

1	Excellent Delicious food Yummy Thai Authentic Romantic Cozy Service minded Luxury Good atmosphere Lovely staff
0	Visited on 11th March during the evening. Very busy and two of us were seated within five minutes if asking for a table. Only downside was we were seated looking straight into the kitchens.Hygiene looked to be non existent with table waiting staff putting up the salads that we're going out to diners. Some staff were drinking and eating around food that was waiting to go out to tables. The floors looked filthy and non of the actual people cooking wore aprons or anything different to the waiters.Completely put off by lack of hygiene
0	I was excited to go and taste amazing food. Unfortunately I was not serve rice with my beautiful meal perhaps someone should have told me it did not come with this particular dish or notice it was missing. The plate was not very hot. The tea was very ordinaire and tea should be serve in porcelaine cup.
0	Sushi tastes weird andthe plates are in paper. Wouldnt go here again
1	"This is truly a wonderful neighborhood find. Atmosphere is open and airy. Food was excellent. BYOB, which in NYC is amazing. Would definitely recommend."
1	This was my first time and I can't wait until the next.
1	"So happy to have found Izola! Ninety six layers of pure heaven, the croissants are by far the best I've ever had (and I've been to Paris)! The chocolate almond croissant is my fave and the sourdough bread filled with handfuls of garlic is amazing, makes the best avocado toast at home! Staff is always friendly and the space is very bright and airy, a perfect place to enjoy your morning cappuccino and croissant!"
0	"Service was no more than one should expect in a restaurant so overall it was... average. It was a nice meal but I'm totally bemused by how it is rated #1 in London - perhaps went went on the wrong day. Anyway, of to Athens tomorrow to check out some other Greek restaurants."
0	Food is good but not exquisite Service is below average Ambiance and overall atmosphere is dull They have nothing to offer
1	We stopped in to eat at cow fish after spending the day at universal and it was absolutely delicious! The calamari was the best we've ever had! Sushi and dessert amazing! Our servers were Brian and Daniella Martina and they were awesome! They were so personable and took great care of us!
0	"As an Italian who's been leaving abroad for many years, I love to try ""Italian"" places, both to feel a little bit of home taste, and also to unmask the non authentic ones, so that I can avoid them and warn others. Indeed, in this case the food is exactly what you would expect from a tourist trap in Rome: average/ good but not exceptional, and definitely with a low quality/price ratio. Service was OK but the atmosphere is kinda cringe: alongside the usual fountain in the patio, and the red-and-white squares tablecloth, they also display posters of the Godfather: I loved the movies but give us a break, Italy is not just mafia!"
0	"Wouldn't come back again. Sat for tapas, nothing great nothing exceptional. The guac tasted. Little strange."
1	"Our stay was great at this conveniently located hotel. Staff was great. Room was clean but soooooo small, it was funny. Hotel restaurant had great food and drinks. A big plus was their willingness to store our luggage until 4:30 p.m. on the day we departed, thus giving us another day to enjoy the city"
1	"Great breakfast, great service, great price!"
0	"Ugly microwave food, dirty place with rude service! Dont go! Part of the meals was cold! Worst food i have ever eaten"
1	"Travelling can be quite lonely, so it makes a difference when you get good service. Second time here, same great server. Well done Kez. Hope to see you next time."
0	When I visited Paris for business I went with my colleagues from Japan.The taste of soup is that the smell of fish is strong. The soup is stinky. The Waitress' attitude of Asian women was the worst. I can not understand why this ramen is popular. It is very unpleasant. It is completely different from Japanese noodles. It is very bad!!
1	"This is a small ramen restaurant. I waited so long in line with my family during the winter that I actually went across the street to another Japanese restaurant that served bento and sushi to eat before. I did it mainly because I was freezing. Kodawari is a small little restaurant that serves pretty good ramen, but not the best I have had. I messed up and had the original ramen so there was not much to brag about. My nephew had their specialty black sesame ramen and said it was great. We ate upstairs at the large table where you share space since it was the only table to seat 5. Overall, a good place to eat if you do not have to wait. Prices are above ramen average."
1	Great burgers! Kind and polite staff. It might be a bit crowded during the peak hours but definitely worth waiting.
0	"Had dinner yesterday night at this place (one burger, a salad and some fries) and now my boyfriend and I are both sick. This really ruined our night. Such a disappointment... "
0	if you like burnt pizza this is the place to go. appalling service. we were told the pizza is made like this while my mate had another pizza and his was good.
1	Great shrimp in the menu. Strongly recommended!! It might be difficult to eat all of it (huge portion)but it’s worth it.
0	The food was very disappointing - the mains were lukewarm and lacking in flavour. Not a lot of love went into the cooking. The desserts were just about passable.
1	Kerala Kitchen: Beautifully spiced Indian food in a smart room
1	This is my favorite restaurant in Bali.
1	"5 stars! Amazing quality, fresh, flavorful, good ingredients, exquisite. IZOLA is one of the best businesses that has opened in East Village recently. Excellent customer service, and everything is delicious! Absolutely recommend it."
0	it was expensive
0	VERY RUDE STAFF and unprofessional
1	"I know Mon Ami Gabi does not need another great review but I have to. We have visited this amazing restaurant on every trip to Vegas. Never disappoints. We sat on the terrace which is a must. The escargot is fantastic, Cesar Salad is wow, the steak and frites is amazing ( French thin style, the way I love it), we finished with Creme brûlée and Tart. The prices are amazing considering you are in Vegas. If there is one restaurant you have to go to, this is the one. As a finale we met the owner of the restaurant, he was having dinner there. The service is above and beyond!!"
0	"We arrived on time for our reservation at 8:30pm and the restaurant was at full capacity. We were not seated till 8:45pm and we ordered immediately since we were starving. We had the tasting menu which was about 7 courses + dessert. While the first 5 courses came out rather quickly, we sat at the table waiting for one of our appetizers for a good hour and we had to get the attention of the waiter before they even realized we had been sitting there for so long. As soon as got their attention we also ordered our dessert for fear of waiting another 50 mins before being noticed. The table behind us had sat down after us, eaten and left before us. By the time we had finished dinner it was 3 hours since we sat down - of course we told the manager when we got the check and did not pay service. The food was okay but was it worth 3 hours of dining time, certainly not. I think if the restaurant was more organized, we would have had a much better experience but given there are so many options in London, I doubt we will return."
0	"More than an hour of waiting was too much!.. we really felt abandoned there, the waiters just ignored our table. Meals were tasteless, steak was too dry and I’d never recommend it, even the sparkling wine did not have bubbles Avoid! The rating of this “restaurant” is tooooo overestimated. "
1	Very good and worth a visit if you are in town.  Had to go back the next day and get some more!
0	Title says it all I sneezed into a tissue and she come over screaming at me to get out with a frying pan in her hand so I stormed out as I got over the road she threw a block of cheese at me and .
1	"Best pierogi in Gdansk, we tried three different fills and all three were so great!We had one asian-inspired, one with chorizo and truffle and one middle eastern-inspired.I highly recommend you to visit!"
1	"Cozy restaurant with Delicious fresh food, fantastic service and atmosphere!! Highly recommended to visit!"
1	Top ribs
0	"Went today for dinner and the only thing I can say is that I was so disappointed,if I could give less than one start I would give it."
1	"Our first visit and we can’t wait to return. We went for the set menu and it delivered well beyond our expectations at the very reasonable price. We varied our choices so we could try 2 x starters, mains and deserts, and all of them were excellent. The tastes were mouth watering and every dish was beautifully prepared and presented. The service was friendly and attentive, and we felt very welcome."
1	Will definitely be visiting again it was very good value and the food was lovely. The decor is really cute so a perfect little hotspot for a girly lunch
1	Best place to visit in Tokyo! Fear not if you dont speak Japanese! You will watch a short intro movie explaining everything - staff will make you feel at home! I recommend the 'makase menu'- where the best dishes are chosen for you.
0	Unfriendly staff!
0	"It was holiday, 011/19, when we arived at 9 am was raining a lot, we huddled on the terrase to wait for other people and were told that we could not wait there. After everyone arrived and we were at the table in the back talking about business, we asked the manager to turn down the music that was too loud, she refused to do. Very bad service!"
1	Excellent dinner last week. The restaurant is certainly one of the very few fine dining restaurants in India.
0	This place was the worst experience in all of Germany. First our food arrived about 3-5 minutes after we ordered which only means that the burger my husband ordered was precooked and not fresh. When the burger arrived it was dry with stale bread and one very small slice of bacon. Not only that we had to ask multiple times for our check and the waiter wasn’t friendly at all. The beer looked good but we didn’t order any. If you come here just get drinks because the food is overpriced garbage.
0	"Boyfriend and I are from out of town- but we know good food. We made a detour to stop by Samsi for dinner because of the reviews we read here. We ordered the ""ten-don"", tempura on rice, and we were extremely disappointed to be given a bowl of soggy, soft tempura over a bed of rice drenched in soy sauce. We raised the issue to the waiting staff only to be harshly told ""yes, we normally serve this soggy"". Sorry, no tempura should be served soggy. Thoroughly, thoroughly disappointed."
0	"Worst possible latte you can get for the most expensive price!! They charge the same as Espresso house or Wayne's coffee, but their coffees are as bad as it can get, worse than what you get for 15 kr in a Subway. And the shopkeeper/barista looked like he was on a dope. Won't ever go here for coffee!"
0	Very slow service. The food took forever to come.
1	Lovely food. Lovely restaurant. Served by Esden who was the perfect waiter.
1	"This was our second time dining in the restaurant but food was delicious , service was relaxed and Friendly and the atmosphere was just perfect."
1	"Clean, bright, spacious with the upstairs space. A great place to meet near Grand Central. I've had the hot chocolate, which is basically a liquified bar of dark and rich chocolate (i.e. awesome). Comes with a glass of water, which is essential to wash it down."
0	"When we arrive the restaurant is busy, and staff is in no control of tables nor bookings. We are told to wait for a table to clear, but are then ignored by staff. Several guest are seated and served while we wait. We were offered zero compensation or discount for waiting, given in an arrogant matter with no excuse."
1	"I'm glad to say it more than lived up to the hype, the prices were reasonable, the interior is gorgeous and the food is great. Hagabullen and Coffee at Cafe Husaren has become a weekend staple for me."
1	Great place! We walked there from the Franklin Institute. Food was good and free of many top allergens. It was nice to just walk in somewhere and tell my teen to get whatever he wants. Seems like their menu items must rotate since they had ribs but not that day. But what we did have was delish!
0	Really lousy compared to other burger places found in town. Expensive and nothing special.
1	Tomahawk Steak was amazing Homemade Carrot cake is must try. Ohhh don't forget to order Negroni & Aperol Spritz best best best!!!
0	"I picked up this restaurant based on really good menu options for quite reasonable prices. We stood up us into the queue outside waiting for a waiter to seat us but nobody was coming, even though people were paying and leaving and we saw empty tables. After ca 10 minutes waiting, a waiter came and told us to go inside and get a table there. There was another queue!!! We gave up! Even though the food looked nice, we were not patient enough to wait who knows how long for even being seated."
0	My wife and I were presented ramen with shrimp that smelled like a sewer. We finished our wine and left the food uneaten. I would urge you to avoid this one!
1	Went unexpectedly with a friend for thanksgiving dinner. I was not disappointed! The atmosphere was nice. The wait staff was amazing and the turkey dinner was surprisingly delicious! I hate pumpkin anything but the pumpkin cheesecake was phenomenal. I gotta catch their happy hour!
0	"This place just does not care about their clients, 1.5 hours for a grilled cheese without even an apology. So, I tried again and then 2 hours for a steak sandwich. I will never darken that door ever again."
1	"There are no words to describe how wonderful and special you made my daughter’s wedding dinner. The food was amazing, the service impeccable and the attention to detail was spectacular. You helped to make this special day even more memorable. Thank you, thank you, thank you"
0	"The service managers are pathetic! Avoid going, food is good but the floor managers are not good at service."
0	we were visitors and were unsure of ordering methods no one offered advise. Food we ordered was average and they didn't even get or order correct
1	"Be sure to order dessert, even if you need to pack it to-go - the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for."
0	Dont go here. Had the worst dining experience of a two weeks holiday. The phad Thai was disgustingly sweet and otherwise bland tasting. The Mai Thai was like a badly mixed soft drink. The service terse bordering on rudeness. FAIL.
0	Horrible customer service we waited and waited and overlooked so we got up and left. Will never return.
1	What an outstanding place. Great menu and drink options. The staff were fantastic and the food was amazing. Thank you!!
1	Could not recommend this restaurant highly enough!
0	Rude staff. Disrespectful to the customer needs and wants
0	"Since it was highly rated on trip advisor I thought we should try it. Although the atmosphere was nice, everything else was bad. The waiter was almost rude the food was not tasty at all (none of us liked it and we were a party of 5). I probably had the worst wiener schnitzel of my life. Beer was good but we really left unsatisfied. I would not suggest this place to anyone."
1	"Found this place for last minute breakfast spot, and I was suprised and happy! The owners were friendly and lind and the food was amazing, made my family very happy!"
0	"Staf were polite, but the overall experience be rather sh*te. Ordering system is overly confusing. Food was subpar and had to wait ages for food, seemed reheated and just not worthwhile."
1	We ordered four cheese pizza with extra tomato sauce. It was perfect. Also starters were delicious.
1	"Very good atmosphere,food,service. Great white wines,antipasti and pizza recomended. Very fast service. Recomended"
1	Sophie and Clancy made us feel right at home and made sure we had a great evening! Never thought the answer to “what drink would you go for” would get the response “well... what is your core temperature like?!” Laundrette froze was a great shout even if my brownie caused some jealousy....
0	"We went here during the Christmas market, and ordered a plate of mix of sausages. The sausages were soggy, clearly they've been microwave heated"
1	"We’ve been visiting this restaurant for many years. The staff are friendly, food is always good and it’s priced right. Well worth a visit."
1	"Great place for dinner! We got the nachos to share and it was very filling. Great atmosphere with good music, right on the ocean"
0	"Thief, you pay tap water at 5 euros, 4 snacks at 50 euros, you exit the restaurant that you are starving. One of the worst restaurants ever. Don't let their kindness and nice faces fool you."
1	"This is not a extravagant place, it simply decorated, filled with helpful and friendly staff who do their best to ensure you have an excellent time. The food is fantastic and very tasty and the portions are very generous."
1	"Lovely meal, great service!"
0	"The meat could be good, but the service is really bad for the expensive price you pay."
1	"Good food, good ambiance, good location. Staff very friendly & professional. Would return again. It was very quiet so intimate dining experience"
1	"If you came to Lisbon you have to try those little cakes from this place, i try them in many places in the city and those are the best."
1	"Great wine, delicious chocolate, and friendly service. We came to 2Beans on a Saturday afternoon and had an amazing time sampling their unique selection of truffles. They also have a wide variety of wines and champagne."
1	We got served by Adrian who was an excellent waiter. Food was absolutely amazing and great prices too. Highly recommend this restaurant!!
0	Very arrogant and unfriendly service.
0	"The food was decent quality but the service was awful and really ruined what should have been a special occasion. Staff were rude and indifferent, they kept us waiting a long time to be seated, the afternoon tea took nearly an hour to arrive (although the food must be pre prepared) and no one was bothered to help follow up on where it was even though I was with my young daughter who was starving hungry. The bill took forever to come despite chasing it several times. Really disappointing overpriced experience, I won’t be going back and suggest you find somewhere else to enjoy afternoon tea - there are lots of infinitely better options in London!"
0	"Took them 45 min to make meatballs with potatoes, seriously?!"
0	Please don’t go here. Tasted horrid. Cold and smelly. Very rude. How it still exists?! Not surprised by the reviews here.
0	"Ordered the rack of ribs and chips. The ribs arrived but when I went to eat them they were cold (luke warm) and were absolutely dreadful. I called the waiter over to explain and he simply took them away and some how heated them up before returning them to me. Now I had re-heated ribs with congealed sauce on them, semi cold chips and no cutlery. I decided it might be best to leave, but they refused to let me exit the premises until I had spoken with the manager. The manager didn’t offer any reason for the awful food, simply saying he would take it up with the chef. A very disappointing evening!!"
1	"We looked for a good Indian restaurant in Göteborg and went to Daawat for lunch. The Murgh Makhani and the Thali were excellent, the Mango Lassi was great and I got extra from the nice owner. Recommend."
0	"Stuck up, moody manager. Failed to describe portion size -  he begrudgingly made a circle shape with both hands as an explanation of the £7 grilled cauliflower. Not flexible with the menu at all. The place was nearly empty but still too busy to be helpful.We opened the takeaway box to find 4 small pieces of cauliflower inside!It was bland, taste was average. Felt completely ripped off. Together with the patronising service, i definitely will not return."
1	"Very delicious food. The restaurant is located in the city of Regensburg. We didn't have to wait long for our and the staff was super friendly. I were still would definitely return back. So, I definitely recommend this restaurant. Enjoy"
0	Did not meet my expectations
0	Awful service. 2hrs wait when told 1hr. Food Luke warm. Not using again. Shame.
1	Great food!!
0	"We thought the food good but the service lacked. I had to wait ages for a drink, my friend, who is coeliac, was advised badly and ended up having pizza for both starters and mains. Surprised no gluten free option for the pasta. I had to ask for water, pepper and parmesan. The sweet arrived without anything to eat it with. When I asked for cutlery I was told that it was crunchy and you eat it with your fingers. I remarked I did not eat with my fingers and the cutlery came with very bad grace. My friend said it was not in the time of Heavy VIII."
0	Worst food and service ever!
1	"Lovely food, well worth a visit if you have 3 hours - service was very slow."
0	"the chicken wings were not adequately cooked so the meat was red. After a second try out in the kitchen, the big pieces were still red"
1	Talia’s food is delicious- so flavorful and the portions are generous. I always look forward to eating here. The staff is attentive and service is excellent. This is one of my favorite restaurants. I highly recommend Talia’s!
0	I have tried to cancel and change my booking a week before the booking which was for January. This was not possible as their booking system has not allowed me to do so which resulted in me contacted the restaurant.
1	We’re lucky to stay close to this iconic restaurant in Buenos Aires. We had great breakfast and coffee. Though pricey you can’t beat the more than 100 year old establishment.
1	The food: deliciously prepared and crafted beautifully The service: the staff had a good knowledge of how the food was prepared and its ingredients
0	"This place has seriously gone to seed. Dumpy, dusty decor. Sticky menus. No Covid safety protocols. Screaming trashy guests getting smashed on budget champagne. AWFUL. Avoid at all costs."
0	The burgers were greasy. The chicken was greasy. The fries were Super greasy. I got sick after eating this overpriced meal which I should of just ate the cost of.
0	"I do not like this restaurant! They serve small portions with almost no sea food, the price is too expensive for the meal you get! "
1	"Every portion of food they put out there is well thought out and balanced. There will always be a couple of dishes that are not seasoned as per your preference, but the majority are. Especially the desserts are mouth watering!"
1	"Always visit when we come over especially for the biscuits they are to die for, the other food was really tasty as well, the service was really good and we bought a gift card for our next visit and was given a free gift of the ingredients for the biscuits to make at home can’t wait to do that."
1	"Amazing food, highly recommend the Bombay Aloo and Naha curry - also great service from Ali - he’s a babe x"
0	"Crazy expensive, but that's not it. Despite you pay so much, you will still go back hungry - the size of the portion main not be even enough. And worst of all, one single toilet for a place that accomodate around 70+ people. Wouldn't want to go there again!"
1	Lunch with 7 friends. Sophisticated taste with very high standard servicw. Made booking 4 mths in advance though
0	Was desperate to eat a curry but made a mistake ordering from these guys again. Really disappointed again to find hair in the rice for the third time.
1	Excellent food and friendly service. We had the Sharing is Caring mix of smaller plates which was plenty of food for two of us
1	"Delicious thai food, authentic thai dishes and very good ambiance overall. We felt like we were on vacation in Thailand. Surely recommend it to anyone who likes Thai cuisine in Gothenburg."
1	"Great place to watch football! Big screen in the garden. Great food and staff are excellent. Nanette served me, very good :)"
1	Exceptional Peking duck and unique desserts (caramel coated banana fritters!) along with your classic dumpling favourites - the menu is extensive ranging from well-known dishes with a twist to yum cha choices. It is on the pricier end but if you are looking for a special night out it is worth it
1	Absolutely loved this restaurant
1	"I tried over 10 chicken rice eateries in Singapore and this is by far my #1 favorite!  The chicken is so tender and delicious that I wouldn't mind having it everything!  Go early as they close their stall when everything is sold, as I got there once at 6:30pm and the staff were cleaning up since everything was sold out, even though the Maxwell Food Center where the stall is located closes at 8pm."
1	"Service was first class and friendly. The steaks, a medium rare ribeye and a medium rare flat iron were cooked to perfection and very tasty indeed."
1	The food is delicious. The best Indian restaurant in the town to have a desi food . The staff is also very nice
1	"The food is excellent, fresh and delicious. The staff are extremely attentive and friendly. We were offered free samples of the numerous, delicious dessert options. We will DEFINITELY be back!!"
1	"Cafe Tortoni gives you the possibility to travel among time, to the days Argentina was a rising star in the south hemisphere. Try an espresso and anything made of dulce de leite and you won't regret."
1	"The food was delicious and the staff all friendly and smiley. The only downside, we were there at the same time with 2 bigger parties, which meant a lot of noise and delay in the service. Other than that, good place for a nice dinner."
0	My Spanahopitta starter was burnt and lacking in filling. The vegetable Moussaka had no fresh vegetables in it; they were clearly tinned or frozen.
1	"This is some real good stuff, I Really enjoy the food and the workers are the absolute best! Best Viet food in SD!"
0	Tasted like a microwave meal. Staff got order wrong and were rude. Plus for what it is it's shockingly expensive.
1	"Amazing amazing amazing! From the door staff to the interior to the waitress everything here was just incredible and such a lovely experience. We were not rushed throughout our meal, the staff were always courteous with trying to avoid disturbing us. I would definitely recommend going in for dinner or even something to eat. It may not be the cheapest of venues to most but you really do get the high quality you pay for and come away with an experience rather than a standard restaurant visit."
1	"Has literally the best steak I’ve ever had in my life here last night. All the staff were amazing, they even took a picture of us which the owner hand signed. Couldn’t possibly recommend more"
1	Superb pizza really freshly made and superbly presented and handmade in front of us. If for the mood for a pizza just come here. Nowhere else.
0	"reading the positive comments, we had high expectations. Alas, the scallops were dry and too sweet, the fried oysters tasted more like fries than fish and the lemon sole was very salty. you'd expect a bit more quality when paying $170 for a lunch for 2 including wine"
1	"Good atmosphere, great value! £14/head for starter, main, naan, and rice. Tuhin served us and was very friendly. Would recommend!"
0	"So we decided to eat here and consequently changed the review - my husband and I ordered a Wagyu steak and at €45 each it wasn’t cheap, the sides were extra so not a cheap meal - I asked for mine medium to well done and it came medium rare - the restaurant was busy and my fault I didn’t ask for it to be changed. I do think the staff can be quite rude - if you are not eating they don’t want to know and one evening we were asked to move so some French people could be seated."
1	"Truly delicious food, we had the dish that was the namesake of the restaurant and it was amazing. Their desserts are sure to put a smile on your face too."
0	We were disappointed with our meal. The steak was tough and the risotto flavorless. We asked for Parmesan cheese to add to risotto and this was also flavorless. It is such a shame to spend 110 pounds for two people and leave disappointed. The topper of the evening is when two large dripping trash bags were hauled through the middle of the restuarant to be taken outside. ????
0	The price of this establishment is insane. We got 4 shrimps for 21 dollars. We got 2 glasses of wine for 44.75. And everything we have received is mediocre.
0	"If you like tiny portions and poor service, you will love this place. But I expect more food on my plate and better trained service. Our meal was more of an appetizer. A ""glass of wine"" for $10 was amusing, but not anything else."
1	"Fantastic meal out for my friends 40th Birthday surprise, the staff gave us excellent service"
1	"Buzzing bar/restaurant. The drinks menu is twice the size of the food menu but the food is delicious. I particularly recommend the lamb rack and sweet corn, which had great flavors. The salmon was also good. The Yellow fish crudo was a little too mildly flavoured for me"
0	"Choosing food and wine was painful. Three servers claiming to be sommeliers separately tried to advise on wine. Eventually, due primarily to extortionate prices, we settled for what we knew we like ($65 made it one of their cheaper wines). It was average."
1	Food was delicious and service was excellent. My two friends hadn't eaten there before and were very very impressed.
0	Whilst good these are not much different from other shops. The staff are grumpy and think they’re doing you a favour by serving you
1	"The food was awesome, they stream the Euro matches and it’s an amazing atmosphere Would definitely recommend for a good times with friends !! Compliment to the friendly staff !"
1	Great Menu. Lots to pick from. Went very late at night but had everything on the menu still. Big portions and great value for money.
1	Amazing food and service! Nice atmosphere!
0	These guys need to spend some time with their grandmothers and re-learn how to cook South Asian food. I've eaten better out a cook-in-sauce jar. Vegetables were cooked to oblivion and the chutneys inedible.
1	"Amazing food with amazing service, especially from Izzi! Would highly recommend getting the sharing platter- so tasty!"
1	Food selection was excellent . Service was great
1	A nice sushi place just a bit of the main walking road. The personell is knowledgable about vegetarian and such. Try number 12 with tofu (the left one in the picture) or number 3.
1	"We were four and tried a great selection of tapas, all the meals were very refined and delicious. Staff are also very friendly and genuine. Highly recommended!"
0	"I’m actually in shock. This was the worst Indian I have eaten, One of the worst meals I’ve had out. Not one part of the meal was good, chicken was tough and had no flavour, sauce was awful - even the rice and naan were rubbish."
0	The food was greasy and very expensive. We went here in 2008 and had a great experience but when we returned we were so dissappointed. We spoke to local residence and they told us it was not as good as it was.
1	The quality of the tapas and the service were just great. Great deal on the Happy Hour hors doeuvres platter then add a salad split two ways and you've got more than enough for two people to be satisfied.
1	"Excellent food, tasty original and adecuated prices. The service is friendly, professional and fast. The decoration is very original is the only restaurant I know with small white little stones as flor. Very recomended"
1	The atmosphere is perfect. The cafe con leche with media luna were awesome. Felt like we went back in time. Pricing was very reasonable too. The steak sandwich was so satisfying & the chocolate dessert was to die for.
0	"Disorganised staff, food 3/5. Came with a colleague for lunch. Waited a while to be seated even though the place was not full. Had to wait another 15 mins to be served. The waitress brought our napkins and put them for us AFTER we've already finished our food. Our Smørrebrøds were very hard to cut and chew, nothing like they should be in Denmark. The bread for my coleague's soup also arrived after he already finished the soup and for some reason he was also charged twice in the bill for the bread. We paid and left without any questioning though because we already spent too much time in the restaurant and had to rush back to work."
1	"They were able to accommodate our allergies.  The waiter wasn't sure about all of the items on the menu, but was able to give answers about what my son could have after checking with the kitchen.  My son had a safe meal, so I consider it a success!"
1	You will not find a better pierogi restaurant in Gdansk. Go to Mandu and see for yourself. It is almost always full of people. Very tasty food. Great interior. Good service. Best kimchi salad ever. Great vegan options. Highly recommended.
0	"I'm continually surprised by the number of people (out-of-towners?) who rate this restaurant highly. The food is so-so (the watermelon-and-feta salad we had on this visit contained only microscopic crumbs of feta), and the service is chaotic. We had to order three items twice, including sugar for iced tea -- which a waiter brought but then returned a little while later to take back again (when we weren't finished using it yet). They're also eager to clear your plates as quickly as possible (even while you're still eating). We've been giving this place another shot every year or so since it opened, hoping it would get its act together, but no more."
1	"Went here for lunch looking for a place to eat outside in Vegas. It is tough to find a good place for outdoor eating in Vegas, and this is one of the best of em. We went for breakfast. Great service , good value.  Alot of places in Vegas have blasting music, this place is nice a soothing, no crazy music. Food was plentiful."
0	"Poor service... Despite repeated request for quicker service as we have my old aged mother with us, the response was indifferent !!"
1	"Good price, very good services, 3 portions of food cost 120 euro, very good position, cheap drinks ."
0	"We always go for Indian food in London, but we will not go again to this restaurant. We went there becouse it was not so far away from our hotell."
0	the staff is a bit untrained and difficult to get a seat.
1	went to Boston to go on cruise .got there two days early went ate pizza was tremendous eats super quick service enjoyed so much when got off cruise went back if you love pizza this is the place
0	The staff here is very arrogant and doesn't respect customers. We requested for a quick service but got a very rude response. We neglected.
0	"Given the high ratings, I expected more. The food was good, but not great. Prices were high. It's crowded and somewhat rushed. The staff were all masked but the people crowding around the bar yakking were not. Obviously, people at the tables weren't masked, but since it's so crowded and you're so close (no social distancing anymore I guess), it seemed a bit of a risk. I wouldn't go back."
0	"Never ever go to this place they charge us for bread and they told it is 100 lira per person and they lied , theyWill try to stole u as much as they can"
1	"As far as I'm concerned, Wendy's all beef burgers are every bit as good as In N' Out! Maybe even better! Baconator Rules!"
1	"Lunch was just so well judged - excellent food, beautifully presented. The journey in from out of town was worth it."
0	Not even being drunk would make this pizza A. Worth the absurd price B. Worth putting up with the rude service or C. Worth eating this frozen food cafeteria-style pizza. The fact that this place has such high reviews is beyond me or any of my friends who I went to eat here with. Locals avoid this place for a reason.
0	I don’t get all the hype. I had an overpriced burger and shake. The burger was nothing special. I could get same burger at Mighty Fine or P Terrys. The shake was bland. A P Terry’s or Chick-fil-A shake is better.
1	A great selection of food. Service first rate.
1	"This was the best café ever: decoration, different choice of pastries, bakeries sandwiches, coffee, etc. And the wallpaper was great!. I will definitely come back. Greetings from Germany and France! Nida BiG BOss"
1	Wendy's burger is fresh and tight.
1	"A treat for all your senses, Fig&Olive prepares delicious beautiful dishes. Located in the lively meatpacking district it is convenient to the High Line and the Whitney Museum."
1	Best steak house ever. We came here october 2021 by chance and enjoyed it very much. So when coming back to London April 2022 we had to come back to see if it was as good. Boy it did not disappoint. Book in advance so you are not disappointed if coming on weekend
1	"Stopped by for a quick meal with friends. I love Korean food and this place didn't disappoint! Kimchi, chap che, bulbogi, etc all great! And very reasonably priced! Well worth a visit!"
1	Always very delicious dishes and attentive service
1	"Good service, excellent food, nice ambience Suitable for family, business or just leisure with friends"
0	"Very disappointed, advertised as perfect restaurant in London, but service was poor and the food was average."
0	The food was not great. And service was poor.
0	The large buns have a core that is not really baked. It will be like a lump. Discovered the lump at home - therefore I did not complain on the spot.
0	Disappointing. The service was slow and the restaurant was empty- very little ambiance. The food all looked good and photographed well but was very overpriced and way under the quality one would expect from a hotel (very bland and dried out). Unfortunately I would not go back or recommend- which is a sham
0	They ask u for a 10% tip? Seriously ridiculous. The service is horribly bad. Overrated and rude service from the waiters here. waste of time.
0	"Mediocure food, and service, they over charged us and the Wi-Fi didn't work. Best to go elsewhere"
0	"We had reservations but were seated as close to the patio (where non reservations guest are seated) as possible by a rude hostess. Our waitress was very hyper and overall not professional at all. A mouse was out on the patio running amongst the feet of the patrons dining out there. Our waitress noticed us discussing the mouse and bluntly stated this is the city and mice are just a part of it. Then she commenced to ask me if I would like to just make our dinner a ""to go"" order. In other words she wanted to get us out of there before attention was brought to the mouse. We had already placed our order but stuck it out and stayed versus walking 20 minutes back to our hotel to eat a cold $100.00 + meal. The food was just average and over priced compared to the other seafood places. The manager was walking around talking to selective guest. We weren't important enough for him to speak to. I would not recommend this place. There are many more fabulous seafood places in Boston to eat at that will treat you very well. Summer Shack and Legal Seafood are two great ones that know how to treat their customers!"
1	I celebrated my birthday here & loved it! The atmosphere was beautiful! The staff was friendly & the our waitress was amazing! The food was delicious! My waitress even brought out a candle with chocolates to celebrate.
1	"You have got to try the Nona Maria pizza. Fabulous. Don’t miss this place for real NY pizza. Greg was the best host. Recommendations, history. We felt like family. Loved this place we'll def be back!"
0	Staff were rude and inattentive. Food was high-end prices for average quality. The decor was uninspired but probably the best thing about the bleak experience.
0	"We must have missed something...this was not the pizza we’ve ever had. We ordered a whole pepperoni and sausage pie and oh my heaven it was dripping with an incredible amount of grease. We’re definitely not picky pizza people, but besides the grease the taste was blah. Perhaps we came on the wrong day."
0	Way too busy - a complete waste of time.
0	"The chicken curry came with one single piece of chicken swimming in a bowl of curry.... With nothing else. No potato, no eggplant, no bamboo shoot, no basil. NOTHING. Just one piece of chicken. Once again, the chicken lacked taste. I reckon I could have made more sophisticated curry dishes than this."
0	Horrible food and waiters. Waiters sell you food. Not a good experience. Alloo Chat is not good. It’s not chat. It’s a vegetable curry.
0	"So cross with this lot. Tempted us in with deals including a free round of drinks. We got him to repeat this and he did several times. Then double act at payment time when the drinks were charged ' Oh sorry, you have not understood, you got cheap meal, we can't afford to give away drinks ' etc with right-hand man joining in. Paid but no tip. Shame as food OK but this was a cheap trick. Beware."
0	"Don’t visit this place ever. Super overpriced, rude employees and dirty surroundings. Just don’t go!"
0	Looks like they are not happy to work here! Very disappointed with the service and place. Will definitely share this experience and never recommend!
1	" Everything is so tasty, you cannot restraint yourself from having all of the dishes."
0	"Staff is rude. One sprayed cleaning solution on the table where I was sitting and another rudely asked me if I was planning on ordering something. When informed that I was waiting for someone, he got nasty and told me that I MUST order something before sitting down because seating is for customers only. I left and will be encouraging everyone to avoid this place. Rude staff and overpriced coffee, there's a Starbucks right down the road. Go there and save yourself the hassle.  Also be aware that if you try to bring the problem to them on Instagram, you'll be blocked like I was."
1	"Me and my wife visited Daawat for the second time. And for the second we were very pleased with the experience. The service is excellent, both personal, genuine and professional. The interior is relaxed and beautiful. And the food is on point, with a lot of spices and good portions. Very affordable and totally worth a visit. 5/5 big love!"
1	Elevated position so bare that in mind if you have mobility issues . The setting is amazing and the food is was as equal. Lovely
0	"The worst experience ever. Upon arriving they did not have our reservation. They shuffled us upstairs to another restaurant and then back downstairs, First sat us in the bar area, then stuck us in a corner table. It was my birthday and my husband had a romantic evening arranged, overlooking the fountains. That did not happen. The food was average at best,"
1	"No other words to describe my experience: MAGICAL !!! From start to finish, I can not wait to return and try all other dishes. Everything was so delicious and we both left with so much taste for more…thanks Baya Baya, for the unforgettable birthday experience, my partner was super impressed and definitely love me more for that "
1	"Beautiful feel, located next to a garden with wild swan running around. The food is incredible, some of the most delicious preparations of vegetable I have ever eaten."
0	"I don't recommended it at all, it was very bad experience, food not tasty, too much expensive comparing with much much better places has beautiful view on Bosphorus, really I don't know why they taking that much for the brakfast"
1	"I am a very picky eater who dislikes pork, however, Schiller Braeu made me change my mind about German food. Before I went to Germany, I decided to eat nothing but pastry as I did in Vienna years ago. I went restaurants just to keep my husband company and only had a few bites of his meat dishes. At Schiller Braeu I learned to enjoy German sausages and potato sides. Even the sour sauerkraut in Germany was delicious, unlike what we buy from North American market. The restaurant has a very pleasant local atmosphere and the most hard-working waitresses considering how many large glasses of beer that they had to carry!"
1	This place is the best! We came here with fri ndw and ordered a ton of things and everything was great. Wait staff was super friendly and tried very hard to make sure we had a good time.
1	"Tried this and our meals were lovely. I had one of the steaks you cook yourself on the hot rocks (it comes seared only), that was fun. Ribs were tender. Nice red wines too. Friendly service from waiter."
1	Utterly divine. One of the best meals of our lives. The administrative staff were helpful and patient. The table we were sat in was best.
0	"The dessert is poor, and I know for a fact you can get a much better Baklava at the Greek restaurant down the road (if you want Greek instead of Lebanese)."
1	Lovely food - service was really friendly and the restaurant had a great atmosphere. Thank you!
1	"Good dumplings and highball. You can practice Japanese here, too. Remember to say hello to Yoshiki, lovely chap."
0	"Certainly not for Asian food gourmets. Tasteless soups, uncomfortable seating, but great decor and sound track reproducing Tokyo suburb cheap joint."
0	"Stumbled into this place with my other half after a long day and what a disappointment. Very close to the Eiffel Tower, you would expect much better. Cold food, grumpy waiters and overpriced."
1	Really interesting flavours. The cauliflower in particular was really well prepared.
0	"Booked 3.5 hours in advance, arrived at restaurant to be told the booking was never even acknowledged. Told to come back in 2 hours and that we weren't allowed to book. Came back after two hours to see a crowd of people waiting and told to come back in another half an hour. We went to eat somewhere else that provided better service."
1	"One nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8, and they didn't expect more tip than that."
1	Good simple Bavarian food...Plenty of meat and great beer! It's location is on a busy street but inside is very traditional with a quiet traditionally dressed courtyard/ beer garden at the rear. Freindly quick service!
0	"The pizza is like a chewing-gum, because of the bad quality of the dough "
1	"Simple and authentic Moroccan dishes. We had the Zaalouk (stewed aubergine) and lentil tagine starters, and the lamb and chicken tagines for mains, everything was delicious. Discre "
0	"Had the most disappointing dining experience possible here last night as part of a party of 12. The waiters and servers were absolutely horrible. To start, they forgot to bring my wife's glass of wine. Then they said they were out, and substituted with something twice the price. But I just felt lucky to pay my bill and get out. Several couples didn't tip, and now I wish that I hadn't. To top it off, the food - steak fare, etc. was average at best. We had several guests from France, and they were just disgusted."
0	"I was very disappointed. I booked a beer garden course and paid 13,000 for two people, but only served about one serving."
1	Good taste Superb presentation Will visit you soon Bombay palace. (Good food always take time so if you are ordering order all food in one go)
1	"Food is delicious and free of 6 of the top 8 allergens! No nuts, peanuts, gluten,  dairy, egg or shellfish. Did not see any fin fish but not certain about that. You pay either by the pound, or get a meal- a salad, 2 sides and one protein. Delicious and affordable for all farm fresh, safe food!"
0	"Disappointment from start to finish. Cold mushy nachos, an insult of a salad (gritty baby little gem with a tasteless mean dressing and a pathetically small burger."
0	Iâ€™m traveling for work and my options were limited. I told them I had a nut allergy and they didnâ€™t seem knowledgeable if their items had nuts in it but â€œwould make a note of itâ€. Didnâ€™t like that at all
0	The meal came out and I took a bite of the burger and noticed a very strong smell. The meat didn’t taste as it should’ve either! I called the manager over who told me that he’d had several complaints of the same nature. I sent my meal back and obviously did not pay for it.What if people came down with food poisoning? Disappointing!
0	"Cold food, bad service and very expensive. However we stopped in late on a Wednesday night after a show and it is in Times Square so what can you expect. Won't go back"
1	The food was hot and very tasty
1	Friendly. Expected tagine to be pieces rather than a chicken leg. They need to sort heating out. It was cold inside. Drinks were nice. Perhaps cut the whirling dervish music.
0	"This restaurant is given spectacular reviews because the management tries to pamper its guests by giving free deserts and other items. The quality of the steak was ok but the preparation was terrible. I order my steak rare with a cold center and when I received it the waiter told me to check the temperature. I informed him it was over cook and was cooked to about medium well (barley any pink and the center was warm). He argued with me for a while saying that it was ""aged which makes it look different"". Finally he left the table and asked the manager if he could take the steak back. After he brought the steak back out he apologized saying it was over cooked and most of the customer’s do not know nearly as much about steaks as them. In all every other table had plastic cows displaying the order temperatures but my table which makes me feel that it was the waiters mistake and he was trying to cover it up. I understand that my experience could have been alter by this waiter but the steak should have never been sent out this overcooked. This steak house is not even close to being on par with other steak houses in New York or other cities."
1	"We ate here years ago with our dairy and egg allergic son, who has since added tree nuts to his list of allergies. We were again really impressed with their ability to accommodate his allergies. They had a great allergy menu, and on top of that, our server was able to communicate with the kitchen about alterations to dishes that would make them safe for our son. She was well-versed in cross-contamination issues, and we felt very comfortable with his dinner. We were there on a very busy weekend night, and they still took the time to make sure we were not rushed and took great care with his meal."
1	"Ate here and had food last night with my girlfriend and had such a good time. I had the vegan beyond burger and me and my girlfriend shared the fondue share board, food came out quick and was really nice. I had a cocktail called a last of summer wine which was amazing. Lovely Louisa served us who has served us a few times before, always really chatty and very attentive, we love coming here and can’t wait until our next visit already!"
1	"This was our sixth visit to the Atlantic Fish Company and as always they did not disappoint The oysters were delicious and the grilled halibut and cod were cooked and presented perfectly. We have never had a bad meal here and the serving staff have always been attentive and very knowledgeable about the menu. The seating is comfortable, especially the booths that seat four."
0	Don’t expect to be in a real japanese restaurant. The staff is entirely chinese without too much manner. One of the waiter didn’t mind burping next to me. I can’t say where the cooks come from but surely not japanese. In the end the food was average. You can find better japanese restaurants around.
0	The girl in the drive-thru tonight at 11pm was rude and didn't take the time to make sure my order was correct. Horrible attitude & service
1	"Ekte is the best option in London for authentic Scandinavian cuisine. I love traditional Danish foods, Smorrebrod, Frikadellers, herring, etc., and all are presents and done exceptionally well. You'd literally have to fly to Copenhagen to find better...and even, Ekte would best most challengers. All ingredients are fresh and perfectly proportioned to grant well-balanced flavors with every bite. The atmosphere is very modern and clean and the staff was very friendly. Restrooms are also very clean and modern. Furthermore, I don't recall the ambient music being overbearing or distracting, so it's perfectly suitable for business lunches, dates, or to treat yourself solo as I did. As for price point, most Smorrebrods are around £8.50 (I suggested 2-3 per person depending on how hungry you are) and mains start at £16, (SEE MENU PIC) so it's definitely on the more expensive side, but again, the quality is there."
0	"Absolutely vile. Most unhygienic pub I've been to. The lady wiped the toilet with the same rag she cleaned the table with. When I mentioned it to her she told me never to come back here. Shocked from this, had to share."
0	It was a nice setting but I can't recommend. Food is bad
1	Amazing little breakfast / lunch restaurant. A hidden gem!! I eat breakfast here several times a week now and they are amazing. They make my breakfast custom for me every time without any fuss. They know what I want and just take care of it. The food is amazing (Charlie is the cook and he knows what he’s doing). It’s run by the owners and they are super nice and always accommodating to their customers. It’s definitely not a chain and that makes it all the better. These folks work and live in our community and they deserve our support. Especially since they do such a great job. And did I mention the food is awesome (and reasonably priced). Good people and great food. Who could ask for more.
0	It's a beautiful place. Unfortunately cocktails come with some extra meet in there... In two negroni's we ordered were a total of 5 flies!
0	"The pricy ”classic burger” was the worst I’ve ever had! Cold, tasteless with soft fries that seemed made in too old oil! Expensive, dull, and small! Don’t go there for food!"
1	The whole experience is really good. My advice to come early in the morning to avoid the long queue. The food is so tasty and don’t miss their JAM.
0	The waitresses are not nice and their stress doesn't let them attend people in a nice way.
1	Amazing already booked a return visit excellent food and service.
0	"Rubbish 'couldn't be bothered' service, a seating area so hot it was not comfortable, an order which they got wrong & visibly just re-plated, cocktail we wanted not available and finally just very overpriced for what it was. Avoid if you can - we wish we'd just gone for McDonald instead"
0	"Stay away! I don't mind paying some extra for good food and excellent views, but in this restaurant you are lucky if don't get food poison! The food was uneatable and the prices were ridiculously high! Shame"
0	"The server at the cafe was very rude, seemed rushed despite having plenty of people behind the till, took forever to tot up the total (2 snacks and 2 coffees). No homely vibe and clearly was preparing for dinner. Still no excuse as it was in the cafe section! Will not be returning."
1	The burgers were amazing and the staff was super friendly. The place is very homely and everything on the menu sounded good. A must try if you are in Paris
0	Too expensive for cafeteria food
1	Best Shisha experience with Maestro Sabri! He would not miss supplying us with charcoal and entertaining us
0	"Food was mediocre, left me truly disappointed."
0	i've been to a few of these chain restaurants and i have to say this one had terrible lobster. It was under cooked and mushy.
0	"Very disappointed ☹️ The restaurant is extremely small, stuffy and we were seated downstairs in a very uncomfortable corner. The food was average to bad. Nothing special, 3 curries with the exact same taste and a tasteless pilau rice! Definetely not a first class restaurant especially for London standards."
0	Wouldn’t come back x
0	Overpriced with average food. The waiter was rude with a lot of people. Wouldnt recommend to anyone.
1	Came here with a large group for drinks after a brunch. The atmosphere is great and the drinks menu extensive (if a little overpriced). The only downside was that one member of our party was looking for some food but they wouldn't let her order anything except for a three course set menu.
0	"This is about a home delivery order. We ordered Tom Yum Goong, Hoy O b, Spring rolls, som tum salad, yum ma muang avocado salad, pad thai, kang kheaw whan curry, pad kra-praw, steamed vegetables, jasmine rice, and sticky rice. Looking for a nice Thai meal. But unfortunately especially the curries were too watery. The seemed more like soup than a curry. Disappointing and unexciting."
0	"Disgusting place. What kind of establishment in this era would offer shark fin, and now Whdle Shark, an endangered species. Scum. Backward with ethics as with food."
0	This is getting beyond a joke now. I've ordered food for myself and my daughter as a treat and was sent the completely wrong order when I said to the bloke that delivered it they said there is nothing they can do. I phoned up the McDonald's responsible and they said they can't do anything  about it but to contact just eat itself as they don't deal with the delivery drivers not even a oh pol in and we will sort it out or we will send something out for you. Now I'm having to wait 24/48 hours for a full refund and still not have the food I ordered I will not be ordering or visiting this place again as they were unhelpful and rude on the phone
1	"This is easily one of, if not the best meal we’ve ever eaten. I cannot recommend this place enough!"
0	We both needed to use the toilet so we asked the barman if we could use it when we walked in. He said it was no problem. The second we stepped foot inside the door of the ladies toilets the manager or owner (not sure of his role but I'm guessing he was higher up) chased in after us demanding that we leave.
0	We returned here after 2 previous visits that we enjoyed and had amazing food..the 3rd time will be our last sadly. We were sent downstairs were it was cold and cramped and everybody bypassed us to the toilets. The waiter constantly hovered over us watching us and made us feel uncomfortable and like we had to rush our food. The dishes were therefore rushed and not enjoyed and felt like we had overstayed our welcome... no friendly chat or welcome just eyes watching.... shame really as we did enjoy the 2 visits previously.
0	"this is just average bad quality restaurant which cost more than a good restaurant actually. Very cold atmosphere, decor is cold, very expensive, terrible food. Food wasn't fresh, herring tasted like cheap cafe food stayed for days and hours in display, meat ball was heated up, not fresh again! It was complete waste of money. It ruined my evening. Ignore all reviews, go somewhere else"
0	Unfortunately on my moms 60th birthday flying into NYC from Tampa we picked this restaurant to celebrate my mom's birthday. We made our reservations on Open Table hours prior. When we got there we ordered a bottle of Caymus and enjoyed our bottle. Then after one hour and twenty minutes later we notified our server and other servers that we needed our food due to my brothers diabetes. No food after 1 hour and 20 minutes is ridiculous! This made no impact at all. We finally got our food and it was ok at best. Our Mom's birthday dinner was ruined and we never made it to dessert. I spoke to the family owner/ manager on my way out and he seemed uh about the whole thing. I'm sad to think on this very important trip we got uh service after paying a decent sized bill! Deliver the service you speak of and do it in a timely please.
0	"Came in first but order did not come after 20 minutes. Complained to owner who promptly told me to piss off. Sure you're popular and busy but bad attitude is not acceptable. Left immediately, don't think it will stop people from going there but be warned."
0	" Our table was in the middle of the restaurant which meant we were continually bumped into by the waiting staff. Arancini starter was ok, nothing special. My wife's steak was cooked without seasoning and the French fries were greasy. Pasta with langoustines was overcooked. In fact there was only 1 langoustine in the dish and it was inedible. Too small a room for the number of guests; too noisy; waiters running about at 100 mph; poor food. Not an enjoyable experience."
1	"I saw this spot on Instagram/Yelp so I had to try it out! I got the sampler and ordered online thru their website. The food looked amazing. Was happy it came with multiple sauces but the best was their homemade sauce. The fish was delicious, all equally great! The hush puppies was on the hard side, perhaps the result of driving ~20 minutes home. The fries were good. I'd definitely come back!"
0	 They have unskilled staff who are not aware of basic table service manners.
0	"Worst experience ever!!!! I highly recommend not giving them your business. Food is good, however they made me and my family feel unwanted because we were not vaccinated even though we had masks. The staff told us we are not welcome unless we show proof of vaccination and my poor family had to suffer and standout in the cold while they kept telling us we are not welcome over and over. I told them to leave us alone and they looked at us as though we were lower than dirt. DO NOT COME TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!"
1	Amazing place . Great staff and would 100 % recommended coming here for dumplings / pierogi . The soup was to die for
0	Maybe we were unlucky but we will choose another restaurant next time.
0	"The food is poor and with terrible taste, Galbi beef was spoiled at all. Last night I was waiting for a hamburger to get prepared almost one hour and it’s taste was like rate 2 of 5."
0	"The drive to Alice's is great, but the stop is not worth it. The wait was long, the parking a nightmare, and the food was the same quality as you'd get from a drive thru window. Everything on the menu sounded good but all 5 meals that we order were obviously assembled low-grade, heat and eat food products. Denny's food is at least another star better. If I had it to do again I would've went back into town and stopped anywhere else. I'm only giving the place an extra star due to the drive and rustic building."
0	"Visited with some friends and was given a deal of a beer, starter, rice and main with a nan bread for £15. The beer was a quarter pint at most and when ordering was told it was a rice or nan bread not both. Ordered Bombay potatoes which was £9 for a tiny dish and some how they added £13 tip on the bill. Food was ok but waited over half hour for the starter and a further half hour for the mains."
0	"Overall the waiting staff are inattentive and the kitchen operation is poorly timed. It's not often that, as I sit eating my meal, all I can think about is wanting to leave "
1	From only the first visit it became my favorite place to go! Loved it
0	"ABSOLUTELY DISGRACEFUL SERVICE AND BORING RIP OFF FOOD... DO NOT VISIT BALA BAYA, UNTIL THEY DISSOLVE THE TWO MANAGERS AND UP THEIR GAME ON THE MENU. I have written many of reviews in the past, but must write this one with particular focus. Firstly upon selecting a bottle of wine, the waiter advised us we could not taste the wine to see if we liked, regardless we went with the flow and selected a bottle (MICHEAL (WAITER) Seemed very aggrieved that we did not follow his recommendation.... I can see from other reviews that this is a trait of his... We then ordered the following: 3 x tasting menus at £42 each Soft drinks £40 bottle of wine thus totaling £195.00 (Including their 12.5% service charge) The plates started to arrive 20-25 minutes later, to our amazement the waiter advised us that each of our 5 tasting dishes would all come on one plate to share between three, that would make each plate £22-25, the size of these plates were shocking even for one person and did not justify the price, they were also the samesizeofplates going to other tables. Further to this, many of the dishes were luke warm (That's being generous) they were COLD........... Prior to commencing our meal or picnic at £42 a head, we raised this matter with the manager, with respect he did reduce the meal by 50%... However we really felt that paying for such poor service and food was insulting, we offer to pay for the Wine (£40). We began to prepare to leave and the second manger approached us and stated in a very aggressively tone,(YOU ARE NOT LEAVING UNTIL YOU PAY THE BILL) We responded firmly saying either take the £40 from our card or we are leaving. (HE THEN KEPT MY LAPTOP RANSOM FOR TWO HOURS, UNTIL I THREATENED TO CALL THE POLICE) I am not joking..... BALA BAYA Came recommended to us, howerer, I must say this was the worst ever eating experience in Europe And especially London. I will be posting the video I have of this situation on YOU TUBE to expose the managers (Please note the waitress was very nice and had no involvement in their approach) Further reviews will be placed by my guests thus to express their disappointment. Based on our experience, I am expected a boring and aggressive response, and I will update this review detailing that. "
1	"The food, service and setting was perfect just as we had expected! Attentive staff and very welcoming. We will definitely return! Thanks again."
1	"Great food, friendly staff, definitely recommended."
0	"he service got a one and that is only because our waiter brought it up from a 0 to a 1! The manager and other staff were horrendous! We booked for a meal after a visit to the Science Museum. Our 18 month of boy needed a high chair, the one they brought over was filthy. Wouldn’t recommend thisrestaurant unfortunately"
0	"We order 3 different salads and neither of them was good. Very plain, tasteless without any souse. It is French restaurant after all. I never eat such bad salads in New York. Burger was OK but overpriced. Steak tart was very mediocre as well luck of spice."
1	"We have been living here for a couple months for business. This restaurant is our favorite. They have great food, amazing service and fantastic view! Would definitely recommend."
1	"Such a lovely place! Very kind service, beautiful and delicious coffee. On my next visit in Sweden I will definitely come back!"
1	"What a great find. Haven't been round this area for years. We stopped for a long lunch. Had prawns for starters hot smoked salmon and a warm potato salad. The menu had plenty of fish and seafood options. The drinks selection was also impressive - we had prosecco and a Sicilian white wine. There's an outdoor space but we say inside. Staff were friendly, attentive and professional. I would definitely visit again if I'm in the area."
1	"We arrived late 2:30 they cooked our food, with no problems they close at 3. Great portions. Charlie was there cooking was super nice the feel and experience was superb. World recommend is your vacationing or a local."
0	Have tried this pub 3 times and will never go again. Slow rude service and the food is not worth the wait. Such a great location for a pub - the menu READS great....that is all it does
1	Excellent service and the Irish mule is the business! Great atmosphere for a night with good friend or a great spot for a romantic date! Cheers my friends!!
0	Worst breakfast I've ever had. Expected alot more quality. The best part was I didn't over spend. Shoulda gotten a crap burrito from Del Taco
1	"Great Location, good food and friendly staff. Even though our waitor ""forgot"" us when we wanted to pay for the meal"
1	"We ended up eating here three times during our Vegas stay and I don’t regret it one bit. Best gluten free breakfast just about anywhere. I had GF eggs Benedict and GF Nutella waffles (just ask, yes they do them). Not to mention, the yogurt is probably an overlooked menu item but it’s delicious and comes with fruit. Everything was excellent, and came out with an allergy marker on it so everyone knows what it is from the kitchen to my seat. We also ate here for dinner, steaks and fries. Tender steak and crispy fries. No complaints. We had coffees with breakfast (lattes and a mocha), very good. We also had cocktails before dinner and the Paris Romance was yummy rummy and my husband had an Old Fashioned with whatever their twist is. Enjoyable atmosphere no matter where you sit. We did love seeing the fountains at dinner though. We’ll be back whenever we’re in Vegas."
1	"Amazing food and amazing service! Martine’s professionalism was great, credit to the restaurant. Will definitely return. Overall you guys did not disappoint"
1	"What a wonderful dining experience from start to finish!! The ambiance was classy, the environment was friendly and the staff made us feel like family! The food was second to none and the owner rounded frequently to make sure that all of our needs were met.“Njishi” means “the first” or “the best” in Albanian. After spending a couple years in Albania, we truly can say that A Club Steakhouse represents all of the amazing attributes of the Albanian culture! Thank you and we highly recommend your restaurant!"
0	"Claimed not to have booking but I had confirmation from Open Table. food was fine but hardly thrilling. They got order wrong twice. When passed banking handset for pin there was space to add tip. I explained to nice young waiter that, unusually for me, I was not happy enough to leave a tip. He said never mind ""there was a service charge anyway""! So that old scam - hoping for tips on top of service charge. Not a restaurant with a rosy future!"
0	"This place could be so much better if it wasn’t for the cold food and bad service. Based on this visit, I would never recommend this branch to anyone."
0	Food isn’t great either. I would suggest you go somewhere else!!! I’m so annoyed I have to pay for this!
0	"I the service was terrible, our waitress didn't smile once. I ordered the pizza which was more cheese than anything else. The cheesecake had no taste to it. Wont be coming back "
0	"I have better pizza elsewhere. If you like your pizza dripping in grease and extra oil, this is the place to go. You will need extra napkins. The waitstaff does not like to give them to you. They have the name, but never had the quality."
1	"Sushi was great and the portions are even better. Great spot out back for people watching. Next time will get a burger, they looked great. "
0	The waitress was very dismissive of my sonâ€™s allergies. When I asked if she could cut up a potatoe and bake it so it was like steak fries she said â€œIâ€™m not sure itâ€™s really busy back thereâ€. Not something any allergy mom/dad or person wants to hear. Wonâ€™t be going back!
0	Looks like the kitchen has gone down. Food wasn't good today. Haven't been there in a while and probably won't be going back.
1	"Foods are best, place is best, drinks are nice! 5 stars for arabian food lovers, will definitely come again sometimes"
0	"Pasta is very spicy for better or worse. However, it doesn't taste fresh."
0	"Truly bad experience. We stopped there just for a drink and a quick rest. Really bad quality, poor service and super-high prices. Don’t go there."
0	"We were so disappointed with Sea Fire Grill. The food was distinctly average and the staff were running around so fast that it felt like we were in Grand Central Station as opposed to an upmarket restaurant. The Calamari were smothered in a really thick batter and the fries were soft, not crispy and tasted of oil. The Filet Mignon was good but that's it. We were a party of four and three of us were really disappointed. We won't be going back. There are so many better restaurants in New York with similar menu's. Staff need to be told that good service does not mean fussing and running around!"
0	Spend your money somewhere else. Tasteless and expensive as well. Nice service but that doesnt help.
1	"Just what I needed for my early start to the day. A tasty Eggs Benedict and coffee, served with a smile from Alexandra. Excellent service. Will be back soon!"
0	"Worst experience I've ever had while being out to eat, definitely won't be back and definitely won't recommend anyone to come here. Service was appalling. Food was average but even if the food was 5 star quality I couldn't justify coming here for the poor service "
1	"Pao is very very helpfull and keeps and eye on his guests. In general one of the greatest breakfast buffet we had in a hotel, fresh and good quality and great variety. We already miss the buffet!"
1	Had a beautiful lamb wrap and tea here. Well worth a visit. Really friendly staff. Surroundings are really pretty. Extensive menus.
1	"We had such a great dinner. All the food was amazing. We had a great time together. Gergő was our waiter, he was kind and helpful all night. Thanks Ape Regina for the great evening."
1	"Very polite waitress, super tasty tapas and good drinks. I appreciate that they spend time making guests feel taken care of. It will definitely be another visit in the future."
0	Dirty
0	Went here because it was close to the Eiffel Tower and someone mentioned it was famous. What they didn’t mention is what it’s famous for because it’s definitely not for the food. I feel like I need to go and eat elsewhere just to get this taste and experience erased from memory. There are too many excellent choices in Paris to lose one here. Big avoid
0	Read the bad reviews and don’t overpay for poor quality. The food was really bad compared to all of the great restaurants on the island. Don’t mind paying for expensive product if it’s prepared well. To be fair they did politely tell us at the end they don’t take cards.
0	"Unfriendly staff, I wouldn’t recommend these people to anybody. There are much better pizzerias around."
0	Horrible service. 86 year old parents had to walk up staircase since you had to have a room key to use the elevator unless you come with a wheelchair. Absolutely ridiculous.
0	"Itt was the worst place I have seen Jamie Oliver should be ashamed to have his name associated with this place The conditions were third world, tables were broken, chairs were coming apart and the food was horrible."
0	"Messed last order up quite impressively, but also to a much less value than paid. Complaint logged on 25th Feb and yet to hear a reply. The customer service department says they're awaiting confirmation from the actual franchise which doesn't appear to be happening. Poor management and abysmal customer service skills, never mind the inability to put an order together properly. If anyone would like to see how to not conduct customer service visit here today!"
1	Recently visited for an evening meal. The service was fantastic and the food great. It was busy but that just adds to the experience. My wife had the red salmon and I had the Argentine Steak both delicious cooked perfectly. Would recommend
0	The main was tasteless and cold. Waiters are not attentive.
1	Small fast casual establishment. Vegan menu to accommodate our milk and egg allergies. We didnâ€™t get a chance to try the food. The soy milkshakes were amazing! Especially on a hot summer day!
0	"We came to this restaurant as a mistake, because we had been recommended a Balti House (it turned out to be another Balti House), and I really had the worst dinning experience of my life.I ordered my favorite dish, palaak paneer, and I got a very very sweet dish with no spicy taste whatsoever. Instead of trying to return the food I tried to order something more to the table. What for! The waiter started asking why, and got really offended, and I tried to calm him down asking what did he recommend. What for!?! He brought me the most spicy and awful dish I had ever tried. And he stood there by my table to see me eat it!! I am NOT KIDDING!! You can obviously never question the food here without putting your life at risk :SPlease stay away from this place!"
0	"This place is simply filthy. Floors and tables are completely dirty. Food is not hot, and of course, overpriced."
1	"Had dinner here with a group of friends -- really lovely cosy restaurant that served great food and had lovely service. I tried the Skagen (Nordic prawn & crab cocktail) Smørrebrød as a starter, had the hot smoked salmon (Hot smoked salmon, warm potato salad, red onion, capers & skarpsås) for the main, which was done to perfection, and finished off my meal with an apple crumble that came with a scoop of malt ice cream."
1	Great food would go again. Good service
0	"Very dissatisfied to be honest. They hardly had a vine list, after about 3 attempts finally got a glass ! There is no real ambience and the service was very average with one guy running around like a headless chicken. The curry was again very average nothing to shout about and the starters were very poorly presented with a few pieces of chicken and lettuce which looked days old. Overall very disappointing and will not be visiting again. They really need to up there game massively if they going to compete with the likes of Pushkar also on Broad St, Birmingham. It’s a shame and sympathise with Covid impact to the hospitality sector, but to survive really have got to seriously up standards, some of which costs nothing extra."
1	"It was cold the day we went. heater on the outside kept us comfortable. Everyone at the table had something different and it all was fantastic. Staff was great, drinks great, food great. The best Bacon i have ever eaten and I have eaten plenty. I'm rating as mid range expensive, but watch your drink orders they will quickly inflate your check."
1	"They gave me an allergy menu upon seating us because I mentioned in the reservation i had allergies. However, soy wasnâ€™t on the menu. When I inquired the (very knowledgeable) waitress said they donâ€™t use any soy in the restaurant! Amazing experience here. Iâ€™ll be going again soon. And the food was great!!"
1	"Had a wonderful time with my wife it includes amazing live shows and great food, service was also great"
1	It’s an amazing place with a lovely ambience. It come here very often to have pancake with honey and ice cream.
1	"Delicious food, great service. Really good selection of food on the menu and everything I had was excellent."
0	"Worst sashimi ever! Tuna served with ice inside, so it's extremely fishy, disgusting! "
1	"We ate there several times, it was always very tasty. Dumplings from all around the world handy made at place, freshly prepared. Completely not expensive."
1	Really nice food and real Indian taste. We did arrive without any reservation. The staff are friendly. We have enjoyed!!
1	"Very good and authentic food! Just a little too heavy for my liking but if you’re looking for Bavarian food, this is your spot! Huge portion size and lots of meat! They also have a huge selection of beer which was very tasty! A must try in Munich!"
0	"A very nice place. Very good home flan, but tiramisu is not the best unfortunately. Someone forgot the coffee marinade in the cake. Still, it's really tasty and I recommend this place. I won't say anything about food because we didn't eat anything there."
0	It´s tasteless and very expensive
1	"This restaraunt was the best dining experience my wife and I have ever had. The food was amazing, and the service was incredible."
1	"Our lunch was wonderful and not rushed. We started with the steak tartare, a highlight for sure!! Big hits at the table were the clam chowder and the burger with side salad."
0	"We got skipped twice, seated at a dirty table, got dirty cups to drink from, the bacon was under cooked, we never got checked on by anyone, and the bun wasn't cooked but it was greasier than the rest of the food we ordered. If i could rate this place a 0 star rating, I would've. Never wanna come here again. 🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️"
1	A real hidden gem right in the heart of Covent Garden. The restaurant is comfortable but unpretentious and the menu offers an edited choice of Moroccan staples at excellent prices.
0	Dirty tables. The service was awful and disrespectful. Very bad experience.
1	Steak was cook just the way I requested medium rare. Service was good. It should of better
1	"Its nice hill top place. We went for dinner and it was awesome. Ambience, food and drinks. Must try place if you are in san jose."
1	Pepperoni pizza. It was excellent and very fast prepared. The staff was helpful and the restaurant had a nice and pleasant atmosphere
0	"the pad Thai was so dry, nard and flavorless that it seemed like someone had left it in the fridge for a while and heated it up in the microwave before bringing it to us."
0	Food was so bad. Tasted nothing like a traditional Tom yum. The shrimps were a uneatable mushy mess.The prices are pretty high too. The place was nearly empty and it took 40 minutes for the food to come. Stay far away
0	"We went there for couple of cocktails and desert at 1930 but even though half the place was empty we were told that everything was reserved... not even telling, for ex,  you can stay for 15 min cause the tables are reserved... not service minded...Gilla"
1	Loved this place we had the feast which was delicious the lobster was so fresh also I had clam chowder which was gorgeous
1	Quick friendly service and the food was really nice. Nothing was too much trouble.
1	Genuine verve and originality
0	The kitchen is downstairs so the dishes all come past in crates. Badly organised and terribly run. I feel very sorry for the waitresses. Horrible vibe.
0	"Food was average, surroundings of the restaurants were very nice but the waiters manners and attitude were a lot to be desired. This dampened the visit to the restaurant. I would not visit again got this reason and I as the customer should decide if a tip has been earned for pleasant service. When the waiter comes to our table after settling the bill and has ringed the tip box and aggressively stabs at that part of the bill with his pen and says tip tip, this is not good manners or what I expect and have never experienced this anywhere before. Left with bad memory of this establishment"
1	"We were here on a Saturday for a late lunch and had to wait outside for about 45 minutes, but the pizza was worth it! We all ordered our personal favorites and were not disappointed. The thin crust was nice and crispy. Service is quick and courteous."
0	Went there and we ordered a korean BBq on table. They gave us a pan with all the beef and it was all slimey and watery. Everything is overly charged and the food was pretty disgusting! Avoid
0	Cannot believe how RUDE the waitress was to us. Definitely will not be returning here. The waitresses attitude was terrible and makes people feel like they aren’t allowed to be there!!
1	Whenever we order Schnitzel we tend to overestimate our ability to eat the huge portions and this meal was no exception. It was very nice but it left no room for a dessert. A nice touch was a group of musicians who provided pleasant entertainment. Don’t hope to get a table in the evening without a reservation. This is not the best part of Munich but don’t let it put you off dining here.
0	"Went with a group of 11 with business in a pre booked table. As title states it was grim, poor service, repeatedly asked for drinks without being bought. Starters were average and the mains were dry, either bland or stupidly spicy and nothing arrived at the same time. Would not go here again given the plethora of curry houses down brick lane. Dated, dull and dingy!!"
1	"Local restaurant with a cute terrace but also on the inside it was a nice place. During our stay in Dubai, we have been here twice to have lunch! Prices were low, the food was good."
1	The food is incredible I love the ambience and service was lovely fully busy and lovely The platter was amazing
1	This restaurant has a separate area of their kitchen where they prep allergy foods. They also had great knowledge on what each menu item contains
0	"Clueless servers and staff.  Manager runs around barely assisting to bring the service level up to ""poor"".    Coffee is good but too annoying to ever go back.  Staff has more makeup than brains"
1	Great food and local vibe. Restaurant had amazing decor and an old-fashioned experience. Can only pay in cash
0	We were disappointed with our meal. The steak was tough and the risotto flavorless. We asked for Parmesan cheese to add to risotto and this was also flavorless.
1	Excellent variety and great price
1	"The taste of all foods ( starter and main course) excellent, hospitality is excellent too, I love this place"
0	"I was charged for water of 39 SEK (normally, it is free) and extra charge of 73 SEK. They said service not included. They take advantage from tourists."
1	Our group stopped here late one evening of our trip for some dessert and drinks and it was really good! The desserts were really yummy and the place itself was very cute. Slow service but other than that i enjoyed it a lot. Loved the patio for its high energy atmosphere right near the Eiffel Tower
1	It's a bit ghetto but the staff are friendly and they do get your food out in record time ( even when they are packed )
1	"Wow, first visit and absolutely loved it! Everything about this place is just right, amazing food, fab cocktails and really friendly, helpful staff! Great atmosphere and lovely decor, we will definitely be back and will bring more friends!"
1	The services is excellent and responsive. Good attitude from staff in accomodate specific request. Delicious food and drinks.
0	"The food is very good but the service was not good, at least for us. The waiter pays a lot more attention to the local peolple than tourists. It took an hour for me to get my food."
0	"i tried this restaurant, the staff are outside trying to get customers to come & try their food, well i did, it was one of the worst decisions i ever made... i wish i had gone to my regular place.... basic food here, the tiniest chicken pieces i have ever seen, more sauce than meat... i did complain, it was shrugged off & the waiter said well it's a cheap dish... i will not return."
0	"The food was not good, the service was awful! The restaurant is not cozy, we took a desert to go and they were tasteless. Not recommend"
1	We dined at Jin Xuan for dinner and had a delightful time! The service was impeccable and the view can't be beat! The decor was also intriguing - gorgeous vaulted ceiling and a blossoming cheery tree at the entrance. The food was authentic.
1	"Love this place, Stacey was super friendly and went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Had two little ones with us and she thought of everything, extra plates, straws before we had to ask. Best place for families on Beech Rd (defo more friendly than Barrio!!)"
0	"Food was average, service was less-than average and value was dismal."
1	"OMG! If you haven't tried this place, you are missing out! The Taste Explosion truly lives up to its name! Prime Time is also amazing! We highly recommend starting with the Crab Rangoon Dip with a little Sriracha! Be prepared to be amazed with the food & service! "
0	Very strangely cooked food. Not authentic indian at all. The malai chicken tikka we ordered was full of some kind of spicy malai which we have never seen elsewhere. Dal Makhani was also very strange and improperly cooked.
0	"I Had a great first night experience, with a fantastic Chilean barman with great beer so much so we stayed till 4am. However our next visit wasn't so pleasurable, as we entered the premises we were stopped by entering any further and asked are we eating, we said no just wanted a drink at the bar. His reply was there's no room you'll have to go. There was definitely plenty of room at the bar. If you're not eating they don't want you whereas it is advertised as a bar and bistro."
0	"60 bhat for a portion of plain rice, which is ricosulously overpriced by Thai standards."
0	This place has the potential to be amazing but given the bad service the whole experience is ruined.
1	"We had a very good breakfast, the poached eggs were perfect as well as the cappuccino. The waitress Denisa is very friendly, helpful, very happy for this early in the morning and she knew the menu and was able to suggest us a very good meal."
0	"My SO and I went here, with a hankering for good, wood fired pizza. I was very let down. The place was very busy, so service was hit and miss. We were not told about the BYO until we were seated and tried to order drinks. Thankfully there is a Co-op over the road. We both ordered pizza. these were billed as Neapolitian, sourdough, wood fired. So I was expecting, thin and crispy with a great tomato sauce. When the pizza arrived, it looked good. A bit of char on the edge, as you would expect. A good amount of toppings and a nice aroma. When I cut my pizza to pick it up (who eats pizza with a knife and folk?) The middle was soggy. half the toppings fell off. There was too much liquid coming off the cheese. I was very disapointed. My SO's pizza was the same. I really hope that this was a one off, as I would love to have a good pizza place nearby but I have not been back."
1	Good restaurant with very green and interesting interior!;)) We had our drinks and snacks there and we liked it quite a lot!
1	"The best meat I have ever had, cooked in a perfect way We came back few times to eat fillets and a T-Bone"
1	Wowww. This bread. These people. I never make a point of reviewing anything but I can't say enough good things about the Izola team and the community Jeffrey has created for the east village and bread lovers everywhere.  Do yourself a favor -- order a loaf of the wild sourdough and an almond croissant next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't regret it.
0	I was really disappointed with the quality of the food. I have had better in many different places. The decor was out dated and dismal at best. The wait staff unfriendly and surly.
0	We went here because of the reviews. The place was a mess. We keep ordering to different waitresses but drinks or food would not arrive.
0	"I waited around two hours for my dessert. Since the main course was quite good but very buttery, I thought they were just waiting for me to digest it. And they BILLED me for the dessert that they NEVER brought!!!"
0	"The worst place I have been, the have unfriendly and rude staff, they treated us very badly. I ordered a dessert and I was served another one, I ordered a tea and they gave me milk and when I complained, the man was rude and did not change it. A traumatic and unpleasant situation we were three girls and the waiter spoke rudely to all of us, he shouted at us, and despite bringing us a different order and not changing it, he forced us to pay it. Amazing a horror scene"
0	"The service was very slow. We got our drinks after afternoon tea was served. A few of the sandwiches were stale and very basic. The sweet treats were tasty and really beautifully presented. Overall an extremely sweet, overpriced afternoon tea. The staff were lovely and very apologetic."
1	"I came here on a date with my girlfriend a few months ago, and have been meaning to write a review for a while. Club A had absolutely stellar food, a lovely atmosphere, and very kind staff. On top of the delicious food, we went there to celebrate a special occasion, and the staff was kind enough to take a complimentary photograph of us and print it for us with a hand-signed 'thank you' message from the owner, Bruno Selimaj (this is still up on our fridge!). I had a really great experience at Club A and will certainly return for future special occasions."
0	"I stopped at this restaurant about 2:00am, December 30 2019. It was really bad. Two waitresses appeared to be just ending their shift and the store was still very dirty with tables not bussed and floors poorly swept. The windows were very dirty. I could see thru the partition to the kitchen that appeared to be as dirty and greasy as the front of the store. When our food arrived the plates were covered in grease and butter so much so that we could see fingerprints all around the edges of the plate. The food on the plate was bathing in a pool of butter and grease from bacon and the grill. I recommend avoiding this restaurant until IHOP corporate comes and addresses the below standard conditions that exist at this store. I did speak to the manager on duty who did try to satisfy my concerns however I found the conditions and quality of the food so poor that I could not possibly have eaten anything prepared at this store under the current conditions that existed."
1	"My son is allergic to peanuts, tree nuts and dairy... the staff are amazing at accommodating us and really have gone out of their way to ensure everything is safe.  "
0	"Been dining here more than few times... the food is pretty good even though in my last experience the quality wasn’t as good as previous visits. Unfortunately the quality of the service is really bad, not professional at all. Ordered a bottle of wine and the manager come to the table with the bottle opener already inserted in the cork. He was also singing in the back... The bread was very dry and probably from the day before. Wines are very pricey for what you get. "
0	"The food was nice, but we had a dreadful waiter"
1	"I really enjoyed it! Food was good, service wonderful! We sat downstairs, next to the aquarium. Next time I would like to sit upstairs."
1	"Small, packed, and delicious. Rightly Michelin - starred. Friendly service in a city that sometimes lacks warmth. Quite a line to get in, too. Be patient. It's worth it."
0	"They gave us zero menu options. We ended up being served bad beer, lukewarm soup, half cooked chicken and bad potato salad. We walked out."
0	"This Burger King is awful it take so long to get your food, order was all wrong and it is cold. The restroom is smelly and dirty. This place should be checked by the health department"
1	I ate here a couple months ago for my birthday and the food was very delicious. I had the Burgushi alongside the Yuzu Lemonade shake. We arrived for dinner after 6 pm and stayed for about an hour. I highly recommend this place.
1	Was well taken care of by the entire staff and got a little extra treat from a very attentive staff called Zafu. Great food and ambience!
1	"Love the pizza, the hype was real. Greg was a great host too. Very welcoming. I'll definitely return. The texture of the crust was my favorite part"
0	Definitely less than expected!!
1	"Best food we had in Goteburg. Service was superb, food was great and really good value for Sweden, Elk was superb, meat balls the same."
1	The breakfast sandwiches were incredible. And no wait. Go! You wont be sorry.
1	Good place and great taste . Loved to be here. The people who work here treat/serve like anything. One of the places which must be visited. Ambience inside building makes us stress less and get ready ourselves for pleasent time.
1	"Cosy cafe on popular street of Haga. They offer hot and cold drinks, food like salad, soup and sandwiches plus some sweets and baked goods. Soup of the day was really good, the salad w chevre was nice but since the cheese was baked in filo dough and then placed directly on the vegetables it became soggy, would have been better if the cheese came on its own plate (or the veggies were less wet). Coffe was good and the almond cookie with nuts and berries was delicious, it don't look like much but it was really chewy and nice. We where allowed to bring the baby stroller inside the cafe but they didn't have a changing table in the restroom."
0	Not worth it. Overpriced for low mediocre food in a very bad location which should make this place humbling.
1	"Exquisite meal, perfect atmosphere and unrivalled customer service. Ali was on top form and we’ll definitely be coming back here again!"
0	Went for brunch and was completely disappointed and unsatisfied. This place is dirty and dingy and it shows. The staff is clueless and managers are unable to give you resolve any issues you may bring up. Avoid this like the plague !!!
0	"Service was fast enough but that's the only good that can be said. The Chinese waiter was rude and once finished we were rushed out the door. The wakame is ordinary and the negative miso just plain awful. With so many other options around, your best bet is to try neighbouring options."
1	"I have been to other indian restaurants in Gothenburg but this one is one that I return to and warmly recommend to my friends! What is good is the welcoming you get when visiting the restaurant, really nice atmosphere with calm indian music in the background, very good portions and lastly is that I liked that they could lower the sting in the food when needed. You will not be disappointed if you visit Dawaat! Service is on top!"
0	 Sides didn’t arrive with the main and when they did I wished they hadn’t. Pepper sauce resembled the water in the bottom of the dishwater just more tasteless.
1	A Colombian family-owned restaurant with customer service and delicious food is the only thing they serve at this restaurant I recommended highly if you're anywhere in the area of South Orlando give it a try delicious lunch and breakfast and dinner menus
0	We went for a dinner on New Years eve. Had booked a table 1 month before and asked for a table not close to the door (minus 13 C outside). Still we were offered a table next to the door and only after asking in a more firm way - we were moved to a better table.
0	The chicken biryani and lintel soup do not taste like authentic ones. Plus the chicken and rice do not seem like fresh.
1	Quick service even though it was quite busy
0	"The burger had good bacon on it but was a little mushy on the end. The fries tasted like Ore Ida -crinkle cut-french fries, I could do better. The shake was a bit more liquid than I like them. For $17 I would expect more. Sorry, it's just not worth the price. Not for me."
0	"We were excited to try Cafe Tortoni and waited in line for about 15 minutes. The inside is worth a look, but the service and food were terrible and over priced! We had coffee, tea, churro and a scone. The churro and scone were stale and we were not able to eat either. The coffee and tea were fine, but nothing special. Overall, not worth the hype. Our waitress was rude, and clearly did not want to be working today. All in all, it was a wasted experience."
0	I should have taken a pic but the wings were dry as wood... I don't have the habit of complaining but this one really sucked.
0	The pasta looked crusty so I stayed away should have just stayed away from this place altogether.
1	"I've been coming to the Rajdoot with friends for years and it's always a great evening. The food is excellent, I definitely recommend trying the chef's specials for something a bit unique. The service is exceptionally friendly and they are always happy to oblige a request, whether it's for an extra bowl of Mr Naga's spicy sauce or even a flaming sambuca. Easily my favourite Indian restaurant in London!"
1	Lovely location and the food was great!
0	"0 spicy at all, service was super slow as was full and not enough people to take care of tables or at least mine ( went with 12 friends)"
0	"Grubby inside, split leather seats, sticky tables and menu’s. Had to order drinks twice, and they still took ages to arrive. Food was very poor, more like ‘school dinners’ mash, with broccoli that looked like it had been sat under a lamp all day."
1	"Food was very tasty and the staff was very friendly and helpful , and lovely atmosphere. We will come back again"
1	If you see a long line - just wait in it! The line goes fast and this food is delicious. My friend and I both got the beef brisket with e-fu noodles - so good. It looks like not that much but it is a perfect size. The beef practically melts in your mouth and the flavors are simple and tasty. Be prepared to eat fast and get out - no dilly-dallying! This place is no frills (you may sit with strangers at small tables for six) but the focus is on the yummy food thar comes out in a flssh. Pay cash and enjoy. :)
0	"Steak was alright, nothing special. My partner had chicken which she sent back, and was put off ordering anything else! Toilets were dirty as well. The manager I spoke to offered to pass my feedback on to the executive chef, which was a fat lot of use to us!! Tables are small and tightly packed in as well. Wont be returning."
1	"Obviously the views are breath-taking but the same goes for the service and the food. The Colombian Eggs are delicious and very reasonably priced, the coffee is fantastic and the service is very friendly (but not pushy), gracious and super efficient!"
0	"I could not feel anything special about this place. It is a waste of time and money. I went there in a group of four. we had 11 dishes. It was HK700, but not worth it."
1	Hands down the best sushi and salmon in Dubai! Great place for all occasions and their staff are very professional. Make sure to visit their MOE branch and sit by the ski slopes! Literally everything is good there!
1	Delightful staff with great recommendations. The salad bowl was delicious with fresh ingredients + incredible falafel.
1	Fantastic. Good food and service. Would def visit again!
1	"Just move to the area and looking for another place I just found this one, What a nice place! Great breakfast (Complete breakfast with Slice Potatoes and Steak) is the best one!! Also you can pay with Cashapp"
1	I had the baked stuffed lobster and it was fabulous! They found out it was my birthday and I had a complementary slice of Keylime pie it was a lovely experience!
1	"Great attentive service, really enjoyable food."
0	"I've only had the matcha latte here, and allow me to say it is the worst matcha latte I've ever had. Reading the reviews here, it made me feel like maybe I caught them on a bad day. Seriously, it smelled and looked like matcha, but the taste said otherwise - bland, neither the taste of milk or matcha came out. I will come back and try the coffee some day, but all I can say is this exp was not as I expected.."
1	Order a cheese with normal crust with bacon and pineapple. The crust was perfect. The cheese was abundant and the pineapple was full rings. Cost was good and the delivery via GrubHub was fast. Please try this pizza if visiting Boston
0	Disappointed in this Red Lobster as the food was not up to par. Not very busy but our waiter forgot 3 items and never came back to check on us.
0	"Stopped in the hotel and this was the easy option for me but still went expecting something original , the reality was that this is fast food at its worst. Had the chicken wings and ribs combo. In my opinion it was tasteless - obviously pre prepared and just warmed through on site ."
1	Great food and atmosphere. The bofsandwich..... Just something else and definitely don't think it's just a burger... It's not
0	"My wife and I visited Schiller Bräu on our last evening in Munich based on its proximity to our hotel and the good reviews we had seen online. We both ordered their Weiss beers which were very good. My wife ordered the goulash which she also enjoyed. I ordered “grandma’s pot roast” which turned out to be very dry. The vegetables served with it had been pan fried and not cooked with the roast. When I told the serving staff that the meat was very dry, they brought me another plate. The second plate wasn’t much better. Since at this point my wife had finished her meal, I simply wanted to pay my bill and leave without ordering and waiting for a third item. When I got the bill, I had been charged for my meal that had twice been unsatisfactory and that I ultimately didn’t eat - which was very disappointing. Overall, our experience did not meet the glowing reviews we had seen for Schiller Bräu."
0	"Well... in my previous review, was complaining about getting raw chicken - TWICE. I went to Bee for the third time (and very last time if you ask me) and got one more bad experience. This time,  i got appetizer for the cost of a main course."
0	The hostess Friday night/ Saturday morning was extremely rude. I was stunned and embarrassed they way she talked to my wife and I. Visiting London this was our first awful experience. We will never come here and recommend no one to ever go here. Hopefully management will ether educate their staff to be tolerant of all people.
0	The service was mediocre and the quality of food was TERRIBLE!! I realize that McDonalds is not gourmet but it was like eating cardboard.
1	"Tried out Red Lobster for the first time after a lot of recommendations. It did not disappoint! Their lobster and crabs were outstanding, and I still occasionally dream about their incredible cheddar biscuits! I also really liked their billing system, with a tablet directly on the table; it was incredibly convenient!"
1	"This restaurant was amazing. My younger children have anaphylactic allergies to Peanuts, TN, chickpea and Sesame. The head chef came out and spoke with us (each time), separately prepared and served their meal(s), and then checked on our dining experience. We ended up eating 4 meals here because the food was delicious and felt so safe. Also, if you arenâ€™t allergic to shellfish, the NE Clam Chowder is amazing. "
0	Rude staff Jackdamz
0	This used to be a Priority-go-to even though their pesto and meatballs contained pine nuts. The staff were always very helpful and knowledgeable and we felt comfortable there. They also double check all of the orders with the chef. On our last visit we noticed some changes to the menu and an addition of  Mortadella Di Bolognawith with pistachios. This caused some discomfort for several reasons. Have not been back since.
0	"Well, it was very noisy and more a bar then a restaurant, the service was terrible and so was the food. Try something else…"
1	"Delicious food always! Just had an afternoon tea with pink gin, all was good, nice food and drink, staff were all pleasant and friendly. Great view over city."
1	"I made a random stop for lunch with a friend and let me just say this mom and pop restaurant is definitely the best kept secret in town. I ordered the French toast breakfast which tasted so mouth watering good and everything was well seasoned. The restaurant is clean and customer service is great. Also, the pricing of food is not too steep on the pockets for the abundant supply of food that is given for the menu selection. Highly recommend if your looking for Breakfast or Lunch!"
1	"Amazing location, ambiance, service super friendly and the food was fantastic!!! A totally French experience with dazzling patisserie in a lovely place. Perfect for a fancy and relaxing brunch! Highly recommend this place!"
0	Incredibly slow service.
0	Its a shame that they decided to triple their prices at the same time that they split the servings in half! The soups are ridiculously small and expensive!
1	The exceedingly good Italian we didn’t know we needed
1	"I usualky do not like to dine where I eat my breakfast, but this was a good exception. Very nice tasting menu, with a good and somewhat unusual wine pairing, like a good rose to the scallops. Absolutely recommended"
0	"This was the only restaurant our group unanimously all disliked. Did we go on a bad night? The food was overly fried, carb heavy, oily (lasagna with cheese floating in oil), cold fries, breaded chicken (schnitzel). Atmosphere was odd - a few Expat men flirting with the NK girls, eating while watching people swim in the indoor pool (?), beer was cheap German type.....Over all we preferred the traditional local fare, albeit same, same."
0	Bizarre place with lukewarm welcome
0	Beware! I was insulted and refused service here. A surly employee seemed angry that he had to take my order. I was ignored for five minutes. When I spoke up the employee left and brought back a 'manager' to council me on how to order. Appearing drunk the manager slurring his words told me to leave and never come back. I never will.
0	"No reviews for a while, hopefully been closed Dow. Just what he deserves. Prices were far too expensive even though it was a lovely view."
0	"We had a Saturday evening booking for 1900 but waited until 1930 to be seated. Once at our seat, chaos ensued all around us, with the bar right behind us, a crate of bottles were dropped thunderously. Moments later knifes and forks found their way on the floor. Later a broken glass. We weren’t left a drinks menu and when the waiter finally arrived the reception was cold. We took the Yellow Fin Tuna starter which was tasty and for the main shared a Chateaubriand with fries and veg. Torching the steak at the table was a cool touch and the meat was tasty but it lacked any wow factor. A decent steak but not fantastic. The fries were from the oven as we see in most restaurants unfortunately. The veg was very tasty and complemented the food well. After the main meal we finally got a dessert menu but after almost 30 minutes of waiting we gave up on ordering desserts. The restaurant has the style to fit the hip Schwabing district but lacked the real substance to go with it. There were too many guests packed in, not enough staff to serve them and the ambience seriously suffers."
0	Arrived to a terribly smoky restaurant. Service is pretty much non-existent. Was wondering why everyone had rated it so highly … we waited at least 20 minutes to be offered a drink. Was not offered water yet many other tables had water. Food was underwhelming to say the least! Steak very average and you basically cook it yourself at the table on a hot rock! Hence the smoky atmosphere. Personally I wouldn’t return. Over priced .. I kept waiting for the catch as to why so many people think it is so amazing?
0	"The food was not cooked to preference at all. We received a burnt burger instead of well done and a well done burger instead of medium rare. The wait for a replacement for the burnt burger was a good 20/30 minutes, which turns out to be more on the burnt side once again. The food was placed on the counter for a good 5-10 minutes after being ready despite the waiters being ready to serve."
0	"Well below expectations. It was my first and unfortunately last visit. Customer service failed on start, forgot about us and we were waiting over 15 min to order food. We ware disappointed about the food as well, because meat was overcooked and dry, potato fritter was burned. Bit overpriced to compare with other polish restaurants. Bay the way restaurant itself need good and deep cleaning. Even table runner was dirty and cover with the old food markings. I think it is time to change them."
0	Great location. Breakfast is ok. My potatoes weren't washed properly and some were undercooked. Lunch is disappointing.
0	Food had hairs in iT. Told the waiter wich Did not Give me any apology. Got a new sandwich which had another big hair on top. Cappuccino was absolutely discusting and staff unfriendly. Setting is beautiful but dont bother to sit down for bf or lunch
0	The beef skewers I orders were dry and chewy
0	Ordered pork belly and got some kind off lever Pata waiter refused believe me when I said that not pork don't waste your time
1	Here's the thing. They don't take reservations. But it's worth the wait. Get there early put your name on the list and then go shop the local shops on Ali'i. They'll text you when your table is ready. Great view of the sunset and delicious food and drinks accompanied by live local music. Make it a stop when you are in Kona.
1	Fancy and  friendly place with great selection of coffee and chocolate. Not as crowded today probably because of the cold but seems to be a good cozy place to hang out and enjoy.
1	We went there as a group of 15 with kids and we were well welcomed. The burgers are fantastic and the cocktails very original and there are many to chose from.
0	"Being living in Shanghai, i've been in several excellent cantonese restaurant i have to recon the place serve high quality food but it is quite boring in the restaurant frankly, and there is no surprise in the menu of interpretations of the classics. "
0	"The food was subpar. For the price charged, the number of varieties was low. They were not doing a good job refilling the food. Waste of money. Will never go back."
1	Traditional setup and surrounding. Broth was delicious but we found it a bit rich. Good quality ramen. Would visit again.
1	The food was very fresh and super tasty with plenty of options! (Tempura prawns were delish!) Staff were very friendly so we had a great time! Thank you!
1	"What a little treasure. We visited by chance and so glad we did. Intimate but lively atmosphere, personal, amazing service and absolutely delicious food. Would highly recommend!"
0	Did you google Korean BBQ and kimchi? According to koreans who's been at your restaurant your korean bbq has no similarity with real korean bbq whatsoever. And your kimchi isn't even near korean kimchi.
0	"Myself and my partner visited this little trattoria towards the end of our stay in Gothenburg. The food really was amazing, we really could not fault it, but the service left a little to be desired, we found the manager, well, we assume he was the manager, to be very abrupt and impatient with us when we ordered. There was one other visible member of staff the night we visited who appeared to be run off our feet. Between finishing our meal and having the opportunity to ask for the bill, we had a very long wait...the female waitress we had seen earlier was busy out back with other customers, whilst the manager serving customers our front seemed to be tied up in a lengthy conversation (very lengthy) with patrons he already knew. This left us, and several others on other tables, looking very anxious to be served. This looks to be a rare occurrence as others have reported prompt service, but new customers that night appeared to be very undervalued."
1	"I always wanted to try a whole lobster, but didn't have a clue where to start. 'Rachel' our server was exceptionally helpful, went over and above I'd say. Food was super tasty and the kids choices were great! wish we had dined here ore than once during our stay, but we will be back."
1	"Lovely food and nice size portions, reasonably priced. We visited here twice whilst we were in Orlando. The staff were very friendly and took time to explain the menu, the drinks etc."
0	"Very slow service, the servers just ignore you and the attitude is just plain rude, never come even once to ask how the food are once the good come. Food is burned at the bottom. Will definitely avoid."
1	This is my 2nd trip to Boston and we love this place. So much culture packed into one place and the pizza is awesome. We’ve always lucked out and missed the rush/crowd but it’s worth the wait if you had to.
0	Not that good and expensive more than other places where you will find better food and tables
0	"We had a table booked for 2 but on arrival we felt a weird vibe when the gentleman at the door welcomed us in. When we got in, the female owner of the restaurant told us unfortunately there aren’t any seats left and their’s a private reserve full of men upstairs. Two major families left the restaurant which left two big tables for seats to be available. Eventually a young waitress seated us in one of the tables but two minutes later, the owner came back and told me and my dear friend to leave? The owner couldn’t give us a reason for us to leave as we booked and their were seats ready for customers to be seated at. We were only two customers at the time. Mind you, everyone at the restaurant is Indian, we were the only blacks and theirs no black employees. This is a form of discrimination and it’s bad for business. Please make sure your making the right decision booking at this restaurant as it’s no longer EastZEast."
0	"Locals advise this place is overrated. True- table not ready 25mins after reserved time, hostess unapologetic, rude."
0	"Don't waste your money at this place. Bad food, bad service, very expensive. We were two people at one of us had finished the meal before the other one got her meal. It is a true ""turist trap""."
1	Wonderful pizzeria. Greg (the owner) makes you feel at home. Recommended their #1 margarita pizza and it was on point. So delicious!
1	We had a great time! Lots of great variety and super cozy! Staff were very friendly! Can’t recommend it enough- check it out.
1	"We ate lunch here today and the food and service were absolutely amazing. Our waitress Anna was   than accommodating. She even moved us to a table by the window for our last course. Each course was delicious, and the lobster was definitely a standout!"
0	"Staff is not friendly, just like you are not paying for food, they just treat you very bad! The managers was rude just like the waiters. The food was ok, won’t be back never"
0	"Just seated for less than an hour, just right after we finished our meal, they cleared our plates and gave us bills. Why doest it feel like im eating in chinese restaurant? The food was okay, nothing extraordinary. But the service was real bad. The way we are told to left was worse than eating in mcdonalds"
1	The coleslaw and cornbread were unbelievable! Ribs were okay and my wife enjoyed her fish and chips. Great service made up for the okay ribs. Would recommend this place over any other restaurant on the strip. Plus it was nice to be by the water!
0	Small portions. Over the top pricing.
0	"Poor service, long wait time, okay food. Suggest you go to another restaurant if you want a pleasant experience."
1	Excellent choice for authentic funnel cakes. Sweet or savoury. Friendly staff and the chic/hazelnut and walnut cream is to die for.
1	Great food and best ambience
0	the cats are absolutely gorgeous and the place is lovely but completely not worth it for food or drink or if you’re looking for somewhere quiet. too many kids and too loud.
1	They know what they are doing and they do it extremely well
1	Delicious authentic Indian food Warm welcome and Excellent service Pleasant address to spend a nice moment
0	"I had high hopes after reading some of the other reviews, but I was left underwhelmed. The food was bland and lacking balance."
1	Delicious big portions for a great price. A short walk from Hyatt Regency and well worth it. Bread seemed to be homemade and had a wonderful taste. Service was fantastic too.
0	"We had to wait in line, despite the ticket saying otherwise. the wind and rain didn’t allow for an enjoyable experience. Way overpriced for what I got."
0	Staff moody as hell. Seemed 1 waitress ..no greeting.. another guy taking orders looked as pleased. . Place wasn't even that busy.. probably 20 people. . After being there a few mins looking at customers looking really unhappy and them looking for the waitress I walked.
0	Service was ok. Tables quite cramped despite current Covid situation. Meal was slightly disappointing. Steak did not have much flavour and chips felt rather underdone.
0	"The Lobster tail was stale and didn’t taste good. The service by waitress was poor, rude and typical of an arrogant culture that leaves the customers with a literal bad taste in their moth, with typical dirty “Paris” washrooms. If you want to get ripped off as usual and eat unsatisfactory food that is not worth the hype, then go blow your hard earned money here...."
0	"Known to be a great restaurant, but after a 45 minute delay on a reservation, a extremely rude hostess, a waitress who gave us attitude, a manager who didn't show up for 45 minutes after we asked for him, multiple incorrect rolls, and all around horrible experience, I do not recommend. We will not be back."
0	"Ordered through Uber Eats, 1.5 hrs after I ordered the restaurant calls me saying they will be late, when they already were.When questioned the Bangladeshi staff started to racially abuse me about being Indian and said all Indian customers are bastards. I hope nobody ever goes there."
0	"Not sure who gives this place good marks. Greasy frozen calamari, over cooked meats. Horrible experience."
0	"Busy restaurant, turning out food like a factory. My waiter was excellent and hard working. But...After recently enjoying big meaty tender flavorful pork knuckles in The north of Germany and in Poland I couldn't resist trying them here. It arrived crispy and dry. There was more fat than meat on the bone and the few shreds of meat were dried out and tasteless. Perhaps it was good news the portion was so small. I'd never go back."
0	"The food has been OK, nothing but the issue is the customer service. The female owner reminded me a lot of Amy's Baking Company."
1	Found this place by accident as I left the train station. It was mid-afternoon so the restaurant wasn't busy and I got a table right away. Menu is in German and English. I chose the venison goulash in juniper and cranberry sauce. It came with a baseball-sized pretzel dumpling and red cabbage with apple and cinnamon. Delicious! Would highly recommend this place if you're just getting oriented bro Bavarian cuisine and want to skip the sausage.
0	"Unfortunately it was not the experience I was expecting, the attention to detail was mediocre and service was of poor quality. Staff were not readily available."
0	"Went for a business meal with a number of my colleagues, we were quickly moved to the rear of the empty restaurant. After 20mins or so we was finally offered a drink, I choose a nice woo woo. Some 20-30 mins later my woo woo finally appeared. Then we got the pleasure of finally ordering some food. I particularly enjoyed the stained menus and went on to order a Labrador. So time later the starters arrived, Good points it was hot, the microwave was still going strong. We was also aggressively asked twice if everything was ok, I dare not say no due to fear of my safety. Then after that we cleared the table ourselves of glasses and pickle trays. Then out came the mains. Bad points Missing dishes, cold dishes, (microwave must of packed up) one sided cooked naan pizza bread Another aggressive ask if everything was ok. Quickly ate what we could and proceeded to pay and leave, was aggressively told to fill in a trip advisor review. I thought to myself, I’m your man for this as I scurried away thanking my lucky stars I had escaped. As the evening drew to a close the meal continued to help various member of our group clear their internal contents rather quicker than they may have wished. One description the following morning “I feel inside out” Over all absolute hell hole would not recommend unless you are struggling with constipation, then this is the place to solve your issues."
1	"We had a really great time for our third dinner there. It seems this restaurant isn’t given the credit it needs! The service is excellent and guests are really taken care of, and the food is excellent. We will definitely come back as it could just be one of our favorite restaurants in Lund."
0	Wish I had read the reviews first instead of just walking in. Overpriced for something below average.
0	"Quality has gone downhill a lot lately upon recent visits, quite a pity"
0	"Food is fine, but the choice of background music is ridiculous. They make you listen to loud disco music at dinner! Very disrespectful."
1	Really lovely little restaurant and bar. The staff really looked after us and were so friendly. The food was great and they have options for those with allergies as well which I thought was great for a pizza place.
1	This is the only pub around the area so worth knowing if you fancy a pint!
1	"We had emailed the restaurant several times when preparing for our trip. They assured us that the kids chicken, beef and fish meals would be safe for our child. When we got there the staff were well versed. The Chef came out after our order was taken to be sure we knew they were aware and able to prep the meal safely. Our child had an amazing dinner and loved the fish so much we ordered a second portion of the protein for him and he finished all that as well. We went back the second night and they again provided an amazing meal for with with top notch service as well. Chefs Allison and Ryan were both amazing."
0	Tonight I had the Elk Filet special...and it sucked.
1	"Ate here as a group, the courses had an international flavor. Antipasto platter, fried whole fish, French fries were a hit. Was the only place we came across good, well priced wine in city. The restaurant is upstairs, not quite sure what was going on downstairs, but it smelled like popcorn and I wanted some. Was good."
0	We came here because this cafe was noted in the self-guided tour on TripAdvisor. The cafe was mostly empty however no waiters even looked in our direction. One was browsing on his phone and so I went to the bar to order coffee. The man behind the bar didn't look up from his iPad and so we simply walked out.
1	"Great outdoor atmosphere, there is some magic to that location. Food is good. Perfect for a nice weather brunch."
1	"Really worth it I would say if u are going for new year's or just important ocassion. Some people would say overpriced but hands down one of the best restaurants I been in London in a long time. Service was incredible, and food arrived faster than expected."
1	we went to here two times to eat and drink.very delicious food and friendly service staff.nice place. lovely
1	"Great Chinese food , good tastinf, fantastic service from Anna , smiling , helpfulf , smart and nice Very smart and nice ."
1	"I’ve been there many time, I tried pretty much all the different kind of ramen. I love them all. The place is really nice, I like the staff behavior, you order and get your food quickly and then nobody is pushing you out. It’s really my best ramen experience."
1	"Incredible, authentic Greek cuisine with absolutely stellar service, what a waiter Ed is! Can’t wait to return."
0	"It was a miserable experience, the service was slow and condescending, and there were no apologies forthcoming on the situation, nor were there any efforts made to seat us in a better part of the restaurant, where the AC was functioning at normal levels.."
1	"A little gem , take the time to go.friendly atmosphere , yummy food. A place to enjoy your whole evening. Good value for money. With exceptional staff"
0	They take bookings despite not having space available and then send guests (not just us) away. Stay away from this place the service is bad and the food is average anyways.
1	"The interior design, service, food, waiters, wine list are all excellent. Definitely, we will be back and even recommend it to our friends who enjoy fine dining."
0	"The staff seemed very knowledgeable about food allergies, and the waiter was willing to double check foods we were unsure of. However, an hour after eating my son developed a reaction (in this case, violent vomiting and puffy red eyes). So somewhere along the line something was missed. I would probably give them another chance, but I would definitely ask lots of questions and double check everything. "
0	"We had a very bad experience, unfortunately. The food was way too sweet, we had to turn down one dish because it was inedible.Pricey for very bad food. Maybe the worst Indian we’ve ever had.At least there was no sour faces as we turned away the worst of the dishes - hence the one star."
1	They make great burgers and sweet potato fries.
0	I don't think I have ever eaten a chicken korma that tastes that foul. It wasn't hot and I couldn't taste any spices or cashews in it. The chicken itself even tasted weird. I'm sure you can find nicer more authentic sauces in a supermarket.
0	Service was terrible. Food just average. So overrated.
1	The oldest cafe in Argentina. Beautiful inside. Day menu not expensive. Quick service and polite staff. History well worth embracing.
1	"We were cautious about eating veggies in Nepal, but this place has cleanliness & preparation down. The food is incredible, and one of the best salads I’ve had in my entire life!"
0	Pushy owner! Didn't get to check trip advisor and we paid the price! In fairness his food is good but he will get you to order things left and right and he won't tell you the price... Totally shocked to hell when we got our bill
0	"First time trying this restaurant and will be the last.  We ordered to go.  The food was too salty and fishy.  Pad Thai Noodles were sticky.  The mango with black sticky rice was a huge disappointment, they actually used white rice with food coloring which turned into a blob of stickyness..."
1	" The meal was cooked to perfection, service was top notch. A gem in the city."
1	"Enjoyed the excellent service and friendly people. Food was creatively prepared, fresh and very tasty. Nice wine selection. Would return on my next trip."
1	"Good meal, we both had the steaks which we cooked to our preference on the hots stones. Staff were very attentive and helpful. Reasonably priced."
0	"Very disappointing visit to the new Dilly Terrace. Service was poor - we had to ask for everything eg extra menus, condiments etc and our simple needs never anticipated. Plates never cleared. The wait for food was around 25 mins for the kids meal and around 40 mins for adults- by the time afternoon tea arrived the tea we were served was cold. The restaurant wasn’t exactly busy. Asked for service charge to be removed. Overall very disappointing and afternoon tea and lounge Menu were poor except for the kids burger. Not returning - recommendation don’t bother."
0	It was our first night in Stockholm and we were encouraged to eat at Jarntorgspumpen by one of the waiters at the front with the promise of best food in Old Town. It was not the greatest quality yet they charged close to other better restaurants.We would suggest there are far better places for similar prices.
1	"Loved the food. staff were very friendly and helpful, great choice , ribs were lush.......for some reason you seem to get so much more on your plate in america than you do in the uk."
1	"The best Indian food ever. I love Indian food and whenever we travel we try Indian restaurants in the area.This was the best we have had by far. I highly recommend it. The setting, service, and the food are very good."
0	"Avoid if you don't want to be fleeced! The waiter was unfriendly and ignored the three of us on the terrace for a long time. When he did eventually bother to serve us, we each ordered an aperitif. Without asking, he made these doubles. We didn't even know there were double sizes, so we accepted these without question. We naively then ordered another round. The bill came to 150 euros for 6 drinks plus 2 glasses of water. To make it worse, the waiter kept asking us to give him a tip and got quite angry when we refused. This is the first time in my 4 years in France that a waiter has hassled us for a tip and been angry when he didn't get one. It's also the first time in Paris where I feel a cafe is doing its utmost to dupe and fleece customers. Terrible. Avoid."
0	"We went there berate my wife birthday. Apparently there was no concept of service at this place. 2 main course dishes and 2 starters were served at the same time and then came the big pause and the rest of the food was served 35 mins later. We tried our best, no one listened. Worst resturant visit ever. Never coming back here again."
0	 Food just ok (I preferred not to finish the korma curry I ordered)
1	Had a good time here. Fridays is Fridays wings and cocktails is all we had and enjoyed them. Service was good.
0	"The recommended wine was served quickly but was a poor chioce. We had to wait for an hour to get the food, and it was a huge disappointment."
1	This small unassuming Restaurant is a tiny little Goldmine of excellence. From the moment we were welcomed to the moment we left it was wonderful. The staff made you feel welcome w
0	"We arrived and stepped into the bathrooms first before being seated and the men’s bathroom smelled of fish. The waitress came up and seemed confused. She ended up getting the orders mixed up between myself and my wife. No big problem, we just switched the food between us and went on. Now when it comes to paying for our meal, she informs us that we have to use the box mounted on the table and disappears. I had some gift cards and had her come back to see how much was on them after continuing to mess with this box. She took forever to come back and finally my wife had to track her down. She told my wife that they no longer have a cashier and you must use the box. What do you do if you had cash? There was only a card reader on the box. The couple in the next booth said all the Red Lobster’s are like that now, so this is the last time we will eat in any of their restaurants. This was our Anniversary and every year we would come here, no more"
0	"The rice was ok, but everything else sucked!"
0	What a bummy place. Shut it down now. This place is a absolute disgrace. I would rather eat dog food
0	Service is unlike a star hotel. The spread of options is very low. No soup and rice on menu.
1	Brilliant food. Awesome burgers. Lively staff. Highly recommended.
0	Really disappointing with the quality of both the savoury and sweet offering. The egg truffle roll was stale and all the sweets were tasteless. If this was the festive menu and it was meant to be special then god help the usual afternoon tea. Have been to many afternoon teas across London and this was the worse. Having to pay a 12% gratuity for this on top was hard to take
1	Authentic Thai dining experience with a touch of luxury
1	"We informed the server of my children's allergies and she recommended the soft serve ice cream, confirming it was free from cross-contamination. Yay!"
0	Average food for the price. Bad service. Stay away.
0	"Long wait and is not the best BBQ, I have had better BBQ on that area, also is expensive for what it is,"
0	"We went for the ""Journey"" in hope that we would get a taste of lots of food on the menu and be able to experience what the restaurant would have to offer as it was our first time. I would advise choosing your own dishes, this journey was disappointing and we felt over charged, almost £300 (granted £80 was on two bottles of wine, but the food served did not really satisfy the price we were charged in our opinion. It's was mostly side dishes and then one main dish to share between three of us. The service was friendly and the venue itself is nice but we trusted them to serve us and impress us with their food and felt that we was given no idea of what to expect and received whatever they wanted to get rid of. The hummus was delicious, highly recommend."
1	Typical Greek restaurant. Food was good but not amazing.
0	"when we got there, there was an additional fee of ~$23. It wasn't apparent on the booking and isn't a lot of money, but it was a tipping point stripping any feel of value from the accommodations, which were literally a tiny pod. For the difference, I'd have stayed elsewhere. On top of what felt like bait and switch, the front desk clerk was extraordinarily rude. We will avoid this hotel in the future."
0	"Long wait, but good service for the moment.  Mcdonald's staff must moov more faster.  They talk to much and work slowly!"
1	We ordered sesame ramen and spicy ramen. Both are delicious similar taste in Japan. The seat is small and little queue even after 1400. Decoration is great.
0	"Everything was terrible and I walked out last night. I was disappointed as well as disgusted. The place was crowded which would indicate the place is popular but the service is worse than slow. If they were going any slower, they would be in reverse. The bread was stale, my lobster bisque was not hot and instead of having the sweet tail meat, they cheaped out with the claw. Two hours after I arrived I was served salmon that was raw in the middle . The waiter tried to bs me and say it was medium cooked when I said my entrée was raw in the middle. He offered to make it well done. Well done.? I said if I wanted sushi, I would have gone to a sushi house. He offered to bring me something else and I said no. I remember him asking multiple times and I finally raised my voice and said you people ruined everything possible. I want nothing and walked out.I am used to better. I go on cruises and frequent casinos. There is a level of service and quality to be expected that I did not see here at the Sea Fire Grill on 158 E 48th St in NYC. If you want overpriced food that takes an eternity and is poorly prepared go for it, otherwise pick a different restaurant"
0	"Very disappointed with the quality of takeout orders. I've been to this restaurant before and really liked it, and have subsequently ordered from Seamless a couple of times. However, the last time we ordered from here, we were all disappointed. I had the Massaman curry, and the takeout container was only half-full. The sauce itself was very watery, the avocado slices on the top were completely brown to the point that I threw them away, and there were maybe three pieces of potato in the curry. My friend had the Pad Thai with chicken, and commented on the fact that there was barely a single piece of chicken in her order. All in all, I won't be ordering from here again, but maybe eating in yields better results here."
1	"My friend and I walked here after lunch and actually really enjoyed ourselves.  We sat upstairs and got to sample both coffee and desserts.  My macchiato was expertly made and the chocolate sampler was really varied and delicious. My friend's latte was really good as were her petit-fours.  However, it is the the service that keeps this from being a 5 star review.  Although our desserts and coffee came out quickly we were kind of just left be.  Our waitress never asked how everything was, never refilled our water glasses, nothing.  And we had to flag our waitress down at the end to get a check.    All in all, a nice spot to try with delicious coffee, chocolate, and baked goods but probably better suited as a to go option."
1	"Very great experience ! Excellent food and good service, I strongly recommend it for a dinner with friends or family"
1	Great bar and restaurant within the Radisson Blu hotel which has s professional sir and a very relaxed feel. Good food. Great service and a trendy environment. What's not to like here!?
1	"good service and the food is always very nice and served hot, you never have to wait too long to be served"
1	"The best Indian food in Gothenburg. We have been here many times with friends and family, more than 50 dishes served with top quality food! What I like with Dawaat is that when you come back you think that it can not be as good as it was last time, but it is:)"
1	Just passing through to catch a flight Gabi gave prompt and professional service. Would visit again.
0	"We did a pizza tour of the North End for lunch this weekend and went here on all the recommendations. I've had better pizza in a mall food court, I just don't understand the love of this one. The other 4 places we tried were miles above this one. Very doughy, cheese barely melted and sauce not very flavorful. I'll pass on this one next time, almost $10 for two slices we didn't enjoy :("
0	So overrated! Feels like it's a place for tourist. Sat down for 2 hours I still didn't get my desert and the bill came!
1	We get takeout from here all the time and the food is really good for a reasonable price (for SF) I am obsessed with the Crispy Baja Taco and Street Style Taco Trio - I get all 4 every time! I usually have a leftover taco I eat for a snack the next day.
1	"Fabulous visit. Amazing service from Janzy, definitely a highlight of our trip to Gothenburg. Great food and drinks."
1	"My husband and I came for date night. We wanted to eat somewhere in Hampstead and after checking online and seeing the amazing reviews we thought we'd give it a try because we love Indian food! The restaurant did not disappoint and the food tasted great. It's a family friendly restaurant and the staff really pay attention to your needs and cater according to what you ask. Will definitely be back :) (forgot to take a picture of the mains, but starters were prawn puri and lamb chops)"
0	"Food and service was ok, but the meat was very dry and chewy (asked for medium). Toilets were very dirty and had not been cleaned for a long time."
0	"Very disappointed. Burgers were basic, meat was burnt. Atmosphere too dark.."
0	"What a disappointment the evening was. We wanted to celebrate the Thanksgiving evening, we arrived after booking a table for 2 a couple of months in advance, as we we were travelling from the Uk. On arrival as it was quiet we made the mistake of requesting a booth near the bar, what a mistake, the waiter service was non existent, our meal was taken by the bar service server, no bread arrived until asked for,no water top ups happened until asked for and only one steak turned up for the main meal despite 2 being ordered."
1	"The food was really incredible, the best Thai food I’ve eaten in a very long time. The decoration was fun as well and made it feel like we were on holiday."
1	Food is stupidly simple but excellent! Atmospheric restaurant with open kitchen consept. Super nice staff. Good wine selection.
0	Very small bowl of fruit salad which was basically an apple chopped into small pieces with a couple of other additions -£6.99 when it should have cost much less. Complained to the waitress Claire who was lovely- manager useless simply offered us more coffee- we had a flight to catch. I intend to formally complain when I get back to the U.K. Jamie Oliver should be ashamed to put his name to this place. Absolute rip off- avoid
0	Our table was booked for 1.5 hours until 16:00 and at 15:50 the waitress came up saying that we have only 10 mins left and suggesting that I should take my dish to go
0	"Unbelievingly over priced and the most awful food we ever had. The fruit cocktails turned to be ""mock"" tails and tasted like cough medicine syrups with very less quantity and too much crushed ice - a camouflage. Hot drinks are also distasteful and felt fake ."
1	My brother took me and my family here on our 1st night in London. It was a really nice restaurant. The food is okay for me. The ambiance is really good. It's a little loud as expected for a bar setting. But I had a really good time. Highly recommend
0	"The food was of sub-standard quality - very small portions, watery tagine (one piece of chicken, 3 small potatoes and 4 olives) and lacking flavour. I left still feeling hungry and "
0	Ordered an Irish coffee and a glass of wine and we were charged 22 euros... The owner also argued with tourists passing by who were taking pictures... This place is a total rip off
0	Service leaves much to be desired. Lots of young untrained girls trying to complete various duties inefficiently. Menu has been changed for the worst. The chicken strips were more than charred. Refried and extra greasy fries the list goes on all served with a large order of indigestion. No sign of any capable ring leader running the circus.
0	Wonderful place but the açai bowl is one of the worst I have ever had.
0	No wow burger and uninterested waitress.
1	"MUST TRY! Our fave picks were the satay skewers, fried chicken, Nasi goreng and the roti bomb with ice cream "
1	Really nice food for alright prices
0	he food did not measure up to the service.It was bland and lacking any distinguishing flavours.
1	very good food and service lovely staff. the atmosphere was nice and welcoming aswell as the menu was overall great and tasty
1	"Great place to watch the sunset, with views to the eiffel tower. Champagne and food were excellent and the restaurant is gorgeous. A little bit over-priced but is understandable due to the prime location where is at. Highly recommended."
0	"Not content with really high prices for mediocre good, the waiter asked if we'd like some bread. My friend said yes, thinking it was like every other place where they bring you bread. After the waiter left, I thought about it and smelled a rat. When the waiter walked by, I asked if they charged for bread. The waiter said, ""of course"" and he refused to cancel the request. They charged 67SEK or $8 for bread. What a bunch of low lives. I don't think they care about all the awful reviews.  They know boat loads of tourists will fall into their trap."
0	The service is not good. The waiter forgotten our order and the staff stood in the bar chatting and did not make eye contact with us so it was really hard to get their attention.
0	"This restaurant is below average based on my previous experiences. Dishes not served a the same time to our group. Asked for spicy, got quite mild food."
0	Terrible service. Never again.
1	"We chose Jin Xuan for its reputation, in order to celebrate a birthday. The overall experience surpassed our, already high, expectations. The reservation process was efficient, perfect and we were able to quickly agree on special requests, related to the birthday celebration. "
1	Delicious pizza that is gonna send your taste buds to heaven. And it's cheap! What are you waiting for? Go for it.
0	"Mediocre food, not great service. I would avoid. Not horrible but clearly not value for money. The service was a combination of poor and indiffierent."
1	What a cute place with a crazy variety of freshly made pierogis!!! We has 10 wild boar/mushroom dumplings + 5 pear/blue cheese and they were certainly enough for my husband and I. We also ordered the slaw and potato/leak starters. This is a mist go!
0	"Simply overrated, overpriced, washed down  Greek food. Beware not to double tip on large parties as it's already included on bill."
0	"I was hungry and it was cold out so I decided to stop and have an early lunch. The most best thing was the mulled wine that warmed me up. The quiche was awful, it was burnt. Definitely the worst food in Paris. Don't waste your money, you would get more enjoyment just eating a baguette with butter."
0	"4 of us came for dinner and were underwhelmed with the food. The chowder was not hot and my blackened sea bass was burned. I sent this back and 40 min later I had to ask where my dinner was, apparently cooked again and burned! Wives swordfish was dry. My meal was comped and got free dessert but still the most expensive meal I never ate at $250!"
1	The pasta is bloody lovely
1	"Best pizza we’ve had this side of Rome. Got the Nona Maria, their signature recipe. Special shout-out to Greg a fantastic host who treated us like family the minutes we walked in. This will be our go to place when in NYC."
0	Food smelly and made from dirty oil. Have to return popadums as they were bitter tasting due to burnt oil. Naan and prathas (breads) were smelling same. My kids refused to eat food and wife almost threw up after reaching home.
1	"A wonderful experience, great food and first class customer service. I would strongly recommend that you visit this cafe"
0	"The food was fine but service appallingly, dismissively bad. If not for the lovely gal who swooped in to save the day after we were pointedly ignored and then treated rudely, it would have been a total disaster. Disappointing."
0	"First time here and will unfortunately will be my last. Tables were to close together could hear the other peoples conversation next to you, felt to cramped in. Ordered a burger and chips, it was ok nothing special. Also ordered a cocktail which I can't remember the name of ( it came in a plastic bag with a fish in) waitress lay it against a glass and it fell onto the floor!! Once it was cleaned up off the floor by the waitress I ordered another cocktail as I didn't want the same cocktail if it was being served in a bag which can easily fall off ! When I received my bill at the end I had been charged for both cocktails even after having a word with the waitress and she knew it had fallen on the floor, not great service. Won't be back again."
1	Wow what a lovely cosy place and experience. Out of this world and into another for an evening.
1	"it is great experience, interesting atmosphere, but You should have time for 1 hour or more to spend in a live line to go in. It is fenomenal - live line was all the time - lunch time or dinner time."
1	Food was amazing from start to finish the staff were brilliant the chicken tikka pie is a must will be back very soon to try other dishes for sure !!
0	"Friday night after theater. Waiter that spends more time chatting up guests than serving. They forgot our drinks and had an attitude when we asked for them, forgot half our food AND as if that wasn't enough we got served bernaise that had separated and the metalbasket the chips was served in was put straight on the table. NOT recomended!!"
0	Terrible and bougie. Avoid.
0	Absolutely woeful AVOID AVOID AVOID stay well clear of this establishment cold food terrible beer and terrible staff
1	"The food is delicious! Nice environment. The service was also very good! Do try mango lassi, full of flavour!"
1	Great food - looked stunning and delicious. Went with a friend who was veggie so had all veggie stuff. Also had great drinks. Good service
1	The best baklava I have ever eaten
0	"I've been here 3 times within the past 4 months and time and time again the service is horrible.  First trip took 30 minutes for food to come out.  Second trip, the server forgot to put our order in, so we waited for about an hour and left because that wait was ridiculous.  The latest trip, we had to ask for someone to take our drink and food order!! We should not have to ask random servers walking by to take our order because of the crappy service.  Once the food was ordered it still took 56 minutes to get our food! I understand restaurants can get busy but when you see multiple tables available it can't be that busy.  Very terrible service, food was sub-par, overall experience was awful and never want to go back "
0	I have rated this restaurant as one of the best many moons ago. However if going for food quality may I suggest an alternative. Very disappointed this time around. Good thing we were outside. The bread and butter used to be complimentary and now have to pay a measly 1.50. More than willing to do so. Too bad you have changed bakeries. Not great at all. Caesar salad ordered by my wife was way over dressed. Got sold the upgraded steak topping. Bad idea. I had pepper steak. Just average. Sorry MAG...lots of other choices. 3 times was a charm Twas fun.
1	"A nice variety of choices, delicious food we liked it. I think its a popular place, we went without a reservation waited at the bar a little. The steakes we chose were good. We enjoyed the camember. The only thing I didn’t like was the tiny tables (which were everywhere in France) you have hard time placing your glass, you water, the dish etc."
0	"Not so cousy restaurant, if you book a table you want to sit in the first part so you can look at the chiefs when making the food. A bit slow service at times."
1	Another excellent spanish restaurant in the La Latina neighbourhood. Enjoyed an outdoor table on a warm Madrid evening.
1	"Stopped here for breakfast as I didn’t fancy the offering at our hotel. The service was so friendly and they were really accommodating, adapting their menu to suit my 4 year old with ease. Food was good - good size portions and plenty to chose from. Couldn’t fault it and would head back next time I’m in London."
1	The food here is well worth any queues you may encounter. Really good size portions for the pierogi which are DELICIOUS - and the pumpkin cake was one of the best cakes I have ever had. LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
0	"If you are not skinny or White don’t bother yourself, you are not welcome at this restaurant! Staff was extremely rude, they put us in a table in the second floor beside the bathrooms and they clearly mentioned it to us; you are not welcome here! They refused to serve food to us. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had in my life."
1	Nice experience!
1	"This is more commercial than most restaurants in the area but nevertheless worth the visit. The menu is extensive and we were not disappointed with our safe choices of pizza and a burger. Warm, friendly and accommodating staff- no complaints about the service. Suitable for families too. Also worth mentioning that the prices were reasonable considering the location - not cheap but then this is Cannes!"
0	"We booked a table for family and were at the place on time. But were booted out to accommodate fairer skin people who were waiting without a reservation. I guess we can’t get over colour superiority. Wherever we see fairer lot, we tend to bow down to them. We gotta stop this guys. To hell with these people and to hell with RAJDOOT."
0	I ordered Kung Pao and it arrived so burnt I couldn't eat it. I'm disappointed this Earl's is terrible. Last time I was there I ordered Fish Tacos and there was little fish in the taco at all. The NW has very few restaurants now one less. I won't be going to this Earls anytime soon.
0	Over hyped and bad service everyone seems to be in a rush when I asked for sugar they took ten mins !!!! And bathrooms are disgusting
1	"Nice service, very kind. There was a surprise for boyfriend’s Birthday! Wished celebrete at here every festival!"
0	"Slightly nervous, no one wanted to wear face masks"
1	This place was absolutely amazing. What a great time with the family and the food was delicious
1	"I've spent Christmas day in London and everything was closed and this place was one of the few open. The service was great, the food was excellent and I'd definitely recommend it."
1	"That was a positively outstanding meal. köttbulle with longen berries, pickles, and fresh made breads!!! All I have to say is wow... Surely never had something quite like that before "
1	The food was excellent and interesting. There was a bit of a wait between being seated and receiving water for which a choice had been requested. This seemed odd given that we had been instructed to arrive promptly.
1	We had to stand a bit in line but it was totally worth it. The pasteis were wonderfull.
1	I'm sitting here surrounded by Japanese speakers in Paris eating excellent udon. I selected the niku udon and the taste is superb. Excellent spice and flavor. Good speedy service too. 👍
1	"True to the history of the 1920’s. Fantastic atmosphere, with staff to match. Such elegance they have and patience, given all the tourists who flock through every day. Recommend getting there early, as soon as they open to avoid the crush. Great coffee. Also, lovely to enjoy a glass of malbec later in the day and watch the tourists wandering through the diners. A real show!"
0	Very expensive and the owner had really bad behaviour. Not to us but on the people passing. I am greek. A greek woman passed and asked if they could make coffee to go. They said no and when she left he told to the waiter: <<did you see the chicken? >> And generally it was expensive and bad behaviour
0	"You know that moment when you walk into a restaurant and you know this is not going to work out? Yep here we go so we booked table for 9pm over a week ago but on arrival many people standing around in bar area not looking happy. Restaurant was much smaller and tighter than pictures. We were told table would be ready in a few minutes twice so over 30 minutes later we demanded table and as if my magic we were taken to prepared table that was clearly prepared way earlier, no apology for delay and no eye contact or conversation from head waiter. Something told us we would be waiting even longer for food so we left before it got worse...... interesting that we spoke to two other disgruntled couples on the way out!!"
1	Really great food from a nicely varied menu. Friendly service and an excellent deal by booking through the app.
0	The place and food is all over hyped on social media. The place is tiny and you can’t sit in comfort or peace. The food isn’t great and the taco pancakes are cold and not made fresh
0	"My lovely girlfriend was charged for her milkshake after it was already taken off the bill, service was pretty ass tbh "
0	"Very expensive, long wait, not much C19 attention, small burgers, mixed up the order, forgott drinks."
0	The flavor is unbelievably wrong. I have a metal flavor stuck in my mouth from this.
0	"Shocking service. 3 people waiting on a table & they were unable to get drinks served & food given to the correct person on the table (even though it was written down on a piece of paper). There were only 14 of us there for Sunday lunch initially (no other diners for a good hour). Service was slow and waiters were not forthcoming. Having said that - food was incredible when it did arrive to our table. Disappointed that they did not have the pudding listed on the menu.. so they offered a disappointing, non wow- factor dessert (which was a rich chocolate, underwhelming mousse)."
1	Nice place and lovely atmosphere! Food was also good!
0	"Rude host, wait 30 min for table even though plenty were available, food was cold, service was terrible. Do not go there."
1	Really good tapas. Nice that it was international mixed instead of just regular spanish tapas. Very prodessional and friendly staff.
0	"Food was mediocre, you can find better Indian restaurants in London. Besides the staff was rude and pushy. We ordered normal rice, what we got was a version which they put for 12 pounds on the menu insisting this is what we ordered. Not the way I would like to earn my money."
0	Prices!!! Over £16 for placek po zbojnicku!!! A bit of joke tbh...
1	Thoroughly enjoyed our lunch at Silver Birch. Absolutely stunning food and lovely ambience with friendly service. The Lemon Meringue Eclair was unbelievable!
1	We had a reservation at Mon Ami Gabi before we got to Las Vegas and we had a very good dinner there at Mon Ami Gabi. The food and the service were good and we will come back again next time
1	We had one dinner at TGI's. whilst the menu may have had many similar dishes to the UK be prepared for much bigger portion sizes!! Great location and good value for money.
0	The restaurant opened late which made us wait outside in the cold for an hour as we had no where else to go.
0	Inedible. Literally inedible. Cramped and uncomfortable dining experience. Stale food.
1	"Excellent service, very friendly, and helpful. We have tried different menu items at 888 including their soup and all of the food was flavorful and fresh. The portions were large which is a big deal when you take starving students out for a meal! The cheesecake is yummy if you have room for dessert."
1	We were recommended to go here and we're not disappointed. The meatballs are so good and the service and atmosphere really friendly. Definitely recommend
1	"Location is very beautiful and well suited for bigger groups, lunch with family or business meetings."
1	What an amazing find. Totallly worth the fifteen minute wait to get a table. Quick service of the best food and great customer service
0	"Trying to be creative, definitely not authentic middle eastern food"
1	They came out warm and were very delicious.
1	"Just awesome , delicious, unpretentious, authentic. Loved it , shame I didn’t discover earlier. Can’t wait to return "
0	"the food was disappointing, some of it tasted really nasty, there was also a £10 service charge, which made an already expensive afternoon tea almost silly priced at just over £100 for 2"
0	"I had their croissant and It was very mediocre. The place is super loud - louder than your average cafe - so if you want to be at a place where you can hear the other person you're with, don't come here during peak hours. Lastly, the staff was kind of rude, so my experience here just wasn't very pleasant."
1	"This comes from a New Yorker, hamburgers and fries are great.Breakfast all day, and you can have lunch after other restaurants close and late night dinner. Love their Whispering Angel rose, actually visited the vineyard, about 1 hour south west from Cannes, worth a visit. Great service. A great New York steak is almost impossible to find in France, that’s why I settle for Filet Mignon du Boeuf, you can’t loose. A filet mignon actually refers to pork, so be to clarify. If you have a hamburger clarify what you would like on it, they otherwise put on some kind of home mayo version."
1	Staff were warm and welcoming. Salad bar was delicious. The red wine sauce with the escalope was to die for! Medieval setting; great option for a touristy treat.
1	"Super friendly and efficient staff and fab food, great experience had by all of the group."
1	Fantastic service and the food was delicious! Our waiter was attentive throughout our whole visit and made sure we had a wonderful visit and dinner experience
1	"The interior was nice, the atmosphere was lovely and service very good. Worth to visit and experience"
1	Very nice and tasty burgers. The interior and the feeling also very beautiful. Would definitely visit again.
1	"First time visiting this restaurant based on reviews, food was delicious, service we received from the young man was exceptional. The only downside was the wait but this was due to how busy it was and only having 2 waiting staff. "
1	Food was absolutely amazing. Staffs were very friendly and attentive. Very reasonable price. Will definitely be visiting again.
0	"You can not see the prices of any of what you have to order, a little short of space as well."
1	One of the best breakfast place and just one set menu.  No need to order and all you can eat..  fresh and delicious
0	Food with sugar...🤢🤮
0	Rubbish service food was ok chicken was dry. I would go somewhere else loads of other places close buy. Lucky they got 1 star or I would give them 0 stars. 😠😠😠
1	So cute and cozy place. Breakfast It was very diverse and all the products were made in Turkish style. The breakfast products were made by the restaurant itself and everything was very natural and delicious. Tea and breakfast were served endlessly.
1	amazing chocolate and delicacies very friendly people working there the passers-by cannot stop without staring great photo opportunities but the taste is what brings me back again and again really have to say this is one of Sweden's finest!
1	The Han Nan Chicken was also very tasty.
0	The food was nothing to how it looked on the menu or on pictures; it was completely bland.
1	"Really good experience. Busy restaurant which added to the atmosphere. Food superb, will definitely return to enjoy the restaurant again."
1	"Chef was able to provide my son with many options, which is rare due to his number of allergies. Food was great and staff were very accommodating! "
1	This restaurant was amazing the food was authentic and perfect. Staff were also very accommodating and really friendly.
1	"Great restaurant, good food, lovely staff too."
0	We had an evening meal here on a short break to Gothenberg. The service was very slow and unfriendly. Food was ok but very expensive. We paid £80 for four adults. This was for one course each with drinks. Compared to the rest of Gothenberg this was a bit steep. They need to get some staff who are interested in their job and able to communicate well with their customers if they want to charge this much
1	Thank You for a wonderful time. My wife thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the meal and we will return next time we go to Vegas
1	"We took our 2 daughters and 4 nieces and nephews (ages 5-13) here, many for their first hibachi experience.    We've been going to this Kobe since i was a kid when we visited Disney.   The wait staff, chef and food was all amazing!!! The restaurant was clean and we enjoyed our time.  The outside area around the restaurant has gone downhill over the years and could stand to be cleaned up a bit but that is our only suggestion! "
0	We stopped here for a quick lunch during a day trip to Stockholm. Time was limited so we didn't shop around - the location of this place was nice and the staff seemed welcoming enough so we gave it a go. Mistake! Two small portions of an average pasta dish and two non-alcoholic drinks gave us a bill of £48. Crazy prices for distinctly average food. Wish we'd looked around a bit more before choosing this place. One to be avoided!
1	"Have visited this restaurant a number of times, the food is always great, especially the dim sum. French Pearls are also delicious but more than a few is dangerous!"
0	Stopped in as a family of 5 this past Monday. The food was terribly slow and once it came and we were all disappointed. We are not picky eaters and all love mexican food but barely touched our plates. $118 later and we stopped for street meat on the way back to hotel. Very disappointing for our first meal in NYC.
1	Amazing service and the food served is really nice. Worth it's points. Good selection for everyone to find it's liking.
1	"Excellent for all ie.Food quality, Clenliness,Service During we have lunch we are impress in part of food safety such as distancing from each others and provide plastic gloves to everyone to take all foods"
0	"This is not an Indian restaurant, I’m originally from India and was disappointed by the food. This is no where close to any Indian food, in fact a lot of these so-called Indian restaurants are not really Indian."
0	They used to be good not so much any more!
0	Had to put my phone torch on to read the menu. Service was terrible. More staff than guests yet none appearing to do very much.
1	"Excellent coffee, baked goods, and chocolate.    This is the perfect place to have a business coffee meeting.  Nothing like the crowded, messy, dirty, teenager-y (sorry kids) Starbucks that are on every corner.  If you need to have a business meeting over coffee, this is your place  This seems to be the current demographic of patrons.  Not many un-business folks here.  More professionals than random folks/tourists/etc. wandering the area."
1	The place is great for a tasty lunch. The prices are very satisfying. We were absolutely delighted with everything.
1	Even though we had to wait a few minutes to get a patio seat it was totally worth it. Ramon was our waiter and he provided the best service!! I had the ham and cheese omelet and my husband had the Nutella waffles. Both were amazing. It was worth the wait to enjoy the nice weather and our delicious food on the patio!
0	"The service ruined everything. It was very rushed, staff didn't leave us enough time to think what we want to order nor to finish enjoying our meals. They took away plates with some food still in them and brought the bill while we were still eating our deserts."
1	"Thank goodness because the food was delicious, the house wine excellent & the waiter very helpful."
0	"I came here for the lighting and space to read, and the music isn't too loud either. However, the staff don't seem like they enjoy being there and gives poor service. The drinks are also more expensive than other cafes in the city (Hot Chocolate is $5.50 for reference)."
0	Oh please !  Overrated and dirty.  Waited in line for nonsense. Don't believe the hype!
1	"Very professional and kind service, we took test menù was good , some dishes better than other but in general was ok, atmosphere nice but could be better. Price for what you have it’s not expensive. Compliments to the Italian girl that took care to our table."
0	It’s good but shouldn’t take 25 minutes to get 3 tacos The lines are not organized. Go elsewhere if you value your time
1	"We had a very great time with our friends. The best italian restaurante in the city. Gergő, our waiter made the whole experience even better. I would recommend it for everyone."
1	We received excellent prompt service from Flame who was really cheerful. Our food was excellent and good value we ate around 8pm and walked straight in. Whilst the lighting was a little dark our waitress lit up the evening.
1	"Good staff and delicious food, live DJ play music"
1	Food was great. The service was impeccable. We loved our experience there. If in Istanbul sultanahmet one should visit this restaurant. I totally recommend it.
1	a very personal experience to eat here with my wife and daughter. great service and fabulous breakfast. Highly recommend everyone to come here. Per person cost around 80 tele.
0	They overcharged me for a large Latte - $6 even. Not only wrong total but more expensive than the Chelsea location. Something fishy going on there.
1	"Have eaten at the King of Prussia, PA and Washington, DC locations multiple times.  Particularly in DC, server was able to go through menu & confirm which items would be safe."
1	"Absolutely superb night from start to finish. The entire team thoroughly enjoyed the fantastic service, food and spectacular views. Our private dining area was the perfect space for the team to celebrate a long awaited get together."
0	It was not a pleasant experience after all. We chose to go for a lunch buffet on Saturday 05/03/22. We were asked to wait for a few minutes although we were there on time. They opened lunch buffet at 12.50 and by the time we were seated & We started eating it was already 1 pm and they started harping around us saying the buffet closes at 2.30. We were wondering if we were at a fast food joint where one goes for a quick bite or we were at fine dining. What kind of a buffet with a 5 course meal opens at 12.50 and closes at 2.30? We weren’t given enough time to relish the food that was served. There was constant interference throughout our lunch. I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone who’s looking for fine dining experience. This restaurant albeit at a 5 star facility is just like any other 2 star restaurant.
1	Amazing pizza. Need to visit. Would have gone back again if in town longer. Staff was friendly. Place was busy but did not feel rushed.
0	Expensive and crepes not good. Don’t recommend it at all.
1	"Fabulous interior, great ambiance and delicious food. Definitely recommend!"
1	"Very nice location, food and service!! Old furnitures, and feels like your taking back in times. We can reccomend this and det Price is fine."
0	We arrived at 21:50 and they close at 22:30. Enough for a quick dinner. But the waiter was rude with us and rushed us to pick the orders. He finally decide to walk us out because he didn't have time to wait for us to decide. He clearly suggested to pick another restaurant!!!!
0	"The tartare de boeuf was ok , the salad was old enough. The cup of coffee was dirty . I asked for the bill and I got it after 10 minutes ."
0	"My fiance and I recently came here on January 18th. This was anticipated to be our best and most expensive meal of our trip to this amazing city. Our expectation were high going in and unfortunately they were nowhere near met. We both ordered 10oz filet mignon and while they tasted OK, they were nowhere near the quality that is to be expected of a $40 piece of meat (this price didn't include any sides). My fiance ordered a baked potato was just alright (hard to mess up a potato), and I ordered the creamed spinach which tasted greasy and disgusting (server didn't care). The food does not come close to living up to the name.The only nice thing I can say about this restaurant is the fact that the setting is very romantic. There's ample space and the ambiance is terrific for a couple. The cost of $130 for average steaks and sub-par sides is not justified. You could pull off the same exact meal if not better for half the price at Outback (and that's a sad thing to say)."
1	Visited this restaurant after the tower. The food was good with reasonable prices and waiters were very attentive. Would reccomend!
1	"Very good place overall. Big variety of dishes, clean, fast service. A Very good place not only to come in, but also to order the takeout. Convenient location, close to the supermarket."
1	10/10 would recommend! They treat you like family and the curries are amazing! Visited here while abroad and it was delicious
0	"As a parent without a food allergy, this restaurant is delicious. For my food allergic child, however, we were extremely uncomfortable with the food even though the restaurant maintains an allergy menu.  There did not appear to be any protocol for preventing cross-contamination and there was no communication with the chef.  So a big disconnect between the special allergy menu (which is just there normal menu with ingredients noted) and what comes out of the kitchen. My child was too concerned to actually eat what we ordered."
1	Amazing food. Very friendly staff. Great atmosphere. Worth every penny.
1	Good place with soft and relaxing atmosphere. We went here to try the Pieroghi and these were very very good. If you want to try different versions of this tipiacl dish this is the right restaurant. Super recommended.
1	Thanks Lorissa for the super speedy service. Yummy and well seasoned avo on toast. Perfect prep for a flight.
0	This has to be one of the worst experiences I’ve had in a restaurant - meat was tough as old boots and undercooked. They couldn’t get a beef burger right. Service poor stay clear of this place.
0	"Salmon was dry, salad was wilted, and spaghetti had no flavor, waiter was inattentive, didn’t bring us bread or water. This place is expensive and has poor quality food. Just go somewhere else."
0	Had a horrible time here. The server was no where to be found. Someone else bought out our food. Didn’t have Utensils for the longest time. Had to ask the bar for Utensils because the server was no where to be found. Server never came and checked on us or how we liked the food. Was ready to walk out. Was very disappointing. Will not come here again. My boyfriend even asked another server if ours left. We thought maybe he was busy. Nope. Just chatting it up with our servers.
0	Very bad service. Treated us as invisible.
0	"The curry was very poor. Lacked flavour. We were very disappointed when we received the bill and they had addded extra wine and food..... they were very shocked when we questioned this, even though we had seen it happen to the last three tables that had paid before us. I wouldn’t visit again and wouldn’t recommend this restaurant."
0	We were given a table right by the entrance door which was open and draughty. After requesting a table upstairs we were told there were none available but eventually after pursuing the matter were offered one upstairs. Service was very inattentive and one of the dishes we ordered failed to arrive. Extremely disappointed with this restaurant which was recommended to us. We will not be going back !
0	The food took an eternity to arrive. After 25 mins I asked where is it? “Oh it’s being cooked” was the reply! food was stone cold and you charge me a service charge.
1	"Really good service, lovely food! We had the small pea soup with sourdough bread, the Skagen open sandwich with prawns, and the Kladkaka (brownie type chocolate cake), plus lingonberry cordial. Everything was really tasty! The open sandwich portion was small, as I expected, but together with the cake it was the perfect amount of food. We were pleasantly surprised to see a big chunk of our bill taken off because they've extended the Eat out to help out discount 😊 We're planning on meeting there again so that we can try other things on the menu."
0	Very very slow service food and beer not nice. This is terrible please not come here again and a bit pricey. I waited for 1 hours for food after several following up!!!
0	Arrived at an empty restaurant and they said they don't do afternoon teas. Very disappointed.
1	"Authentic taste and very attentive staff, the food comes out super quick and is very fresh and of great quality, it's a quaint little restaurant good to enjoy with friends or as a couple"
0	"Low quality, salty, garlicky. Gives me really bad indigestion every time and makes me feel bloated"
0	Awful service and dishes. Choice is limited
0	There was only one member of staff attending everyone and he was overwhelmed with customers. Food was bland and cold upon being served.
1	Unexpected quality. Typical (variation of) Swedish food. Sensational vegetarian starter with goat cheese and beetroot chips and other delicious vegetables. All three main courses were fantastic. We enjoyed it very much.
0	"Wasn't impressed with this branch. I ordered chicken, chips and coleslaw, the chips were very dry and seen better days. The music was overly loud and couldn't hear yourself speak. Won't be going back to Nandos in a while!!!"
0	"I've always love Maman downtown. Visited the midtown location recently for togo. I got a slice of quiche, the one with blue cheese and pear. The tab said $6.5 but while I paid it was $13. The guy the tab was weekday price. Oh wow. Okayyy. I got ripped off. The quiche does not have any blue cheese flavor nor any chunk of pear. Disappointed."
1	"De Plantage has everything you need for a great dinner with friends and family: friendly staff, delicious food, fast service, beautiful location."
1	This restaurant offers a perfect view over the lovely Gothenburg city.
0	This restaurant did a very poor job with my allergy. I am allergic to peanuts and tree nuts. I asked about the rolls on their burgers and they said that they recommended I not eat the roll. I was shocked. They also told me they were not sure about some of the other items on the menu. I was very uncomfortable and upset and chose not to eat anything. My family left the restaurant and decided to eat somewhere else. I would not recommend this restaurant or its chain to anyone who has any type of allergy.
0	"We visited this restaurant on Wednesday evening. The food was ok, but service… omg. No one attended to us when we entered so, after some waiting, we just chose a random table. Clever people would have left at this point but we were not and Indian restaurant across the road was fully booked so we had little choice. After trying to attract a waiter’s attention for 5-10 minutes he appeared at the table greeting us with “are you ready to order?”. Obviously he hasn’t tried the menu and was of little help. The starters, as expected, arrived without any water or drinks. Only when we finished them and talked to waiters water, wine and aperitifs appeared. I guess the concept of aperitifs did not reach Ekte. No one from our company will step into this place again"
1	The best steak I have ever eaten ! Atmosphere and service in the restaurant were exemplary. Incredible wine choice and the steak was fantastic
0	Nothing to do with France or French cuisine. Avoid!
1	"Family of 4 for dinner and service was very good along with quality and quantity of food. The famed US customer service has not been what I expected over the last 2 weeks but this was exactly what I was expecting, warm welcome and attentive service. Food was good quality with no complaints from two teenagers. Only downside was being charged for one of the boys playing a game on the table monitor. He said it did not warn him there was a charge and thankfully he only played one game but beware."
1	A few friends took me to Turn n Tender in Midstream. It was delicious...the food was really great. The menu is extensive. The serving portions are generous. The staff very friendly. Enjoyed very much.
1	"Awesome Indian food and staff, Abdur and Rahman helped us a lot because se didnt know what to order. We Will repeat for sure"
1	Excellent food and service
1	Nice location and the diner itself is modern and pretty. We enjoyed our food. They were all very good and the portions were large.
0	"The fish was overly fried and dry to the extent that it was so rock-hard you could chip your tooth on it. Not to mention, it was completely tasteless and we had to ask for extra fish sauce to give it some taste. The ""mango salad"" had no mango in it."
1	It's a really cute place with two floors. Then I felt like I was back in Miami Beach with the bathroom charges at the door. The food was standard for the restaurant chain. The atmosphere was fun.
1	" have never take such delicious variety of sushi even in Japan. Ambiance, decoration service and food is jut fabulous."
0	"I knew there would be trouble when the hostess could not tear herself away from her phone to check us in. She seated us and someone brought some lukewarm bread to our table. The server took our order and we sat there for forty five minutes. When our food arrived, it was ice cold. My filet was supposed to be medium and it was well done. The plate was stone cold and the meat was dry and over cooked. I could not eat it. We ordered dessert. The ice cream was not a premium grade. It was not rich or creamy. The chocolate cake was misrepresented. It was supposed to be covered with ganache, but was not. It was iced with a lackluster sticky chocolate frosting. The entire meal was an epic fail and so was the service. "
1	"Had a very enjoyable meal here on a random Thursday. Great service from the waiter Joy, made me feel very welcome. Definitely recommended."
1	Excellent service and the best in class south Indian food. The awesome coffee I had is truly good of quality and reciprocates the taste of tamiladu. The breakfast buffet is one the best I've seen. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The perfect place to start a busy day in Chennai....
1	"Favorite place in the NYC. Menu is changing and so creative. Nice atmosphere, don’t expect big portions as it’s all about the taste."
1	"The interiors are particularly scenic and tell, in some elements, the typical architecture of the place."
1	"Very kind bartender immediately addressed my allergy concerns, communicated with the kitchen and advised me. I ate delicious, safe food."
0	"Had me waiting 1hr by they gave me my complete order,my burgers were cold. Don't waste your time in with this place not worth the price."
1	"We visited with friends last night and had a fantastic evening. The surroundings, food and service was superb. I particularly enjoyed the sea urchin but to be honest, everything we ate was first class. We drank an Argentinian Malbec which was stunning and very reasonably priced. The manager was knowledgable, attentive and we all enjoyed our interactions with him. The other staff did not let him down and again added to our time there. All in all an exceptional evening and if they can keep it up they will go from strength to strength. Good luck!"
0	The kitchen substitutes items not mentioned on the menu in certain dishes.
1	Their chili crab and walnut prawns are to die for. A must try for anyone visiting Singapore with an appetite for seafood! The only thing that put me off was sitting next to an annoying party at the same table.
1	"We ate here on our first night in Cannes. We were starving so we just went in not knowing what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised, food was good, service was good and friendly, price was ok. Would recommend."
0	"Just few words: 80€ for two plat, 2 desserts and 6 glass of wine. I like the place, really very romantic, but too much expensive for nothing special."
1	"Jhett, our waiter was the man, super friendly and attentive. The food and drinks were both on point!Thanks chef!"
0	"Food is okay but REALLY overpriced. Don't go there if you are hungry, not accustomed to unusual ingredients combinations, and are not prepared to pay £50-60. Also, music is a bit too loud. "
1	"They were able to provide an PA friendly meal for my son, but it was one of those situations where I had to trust that they knew what they were doing. There was no explanation, or allergen list. I chose something that wasn't likely to contain peanuts and asked them to prepare it away from peanuts. And they did. "
1	" the service was brilliant! The cook even came out to make sure we were enjoying the meal.As you can see, I can't recommend this place highly enough."
0	"I wanted to give this restaurant a better rating.  Like the previous reviews, we felt the staff was knowledgeable about food allergies and took our concerns seriously.  We didn't have a problem finding something that was acceptable and my son's plate came out to the table separately as the ""food allergy prepared"" order.  He did, however, develop a mouth hive as we were finishing and I am convinced it was a cross contamination issue."
1	We ordered traditional swedish dish. The food was quite good. So was the service. The wine selection was good as well. Over all an excellent experience. A rare full house from me
0	"Not great for gluten free/celiac diners. The hostess told us that 85% of the menu could be modified BUT the server told me the only gluten free options were pan-seared fish and steamed vegetables. I find it a bit pricey to have to eat like an ailing geriatric - I run marathons and I need food, and I had to get food after dining there! The restaurant does not offer gluten free rolls or bread according to the waiter. The last time I dined here, at the bar, I had lobster newburg without the pastry shell and over potatoes instead, so something has happened to cause Atlantic Fish to change its policy for serving diners with allergies. Maybe they just don't have the ability to clean the cooking surface and have too much cross-contamination in their kitchen. With Legal Seafood and Select Oyster blocks away, I don't thing I will be returning. Who wants to leave a restaurant hungry?"
1	Saw the great reviews and tried it out. Steady for a weekday night but had the antipasto and a couple of pizzas. Dough and Pizza delicious abs friendly service - we will be back.
1	This restaurant was recommended to us by a friend and it was worth the recommendation. The food was delicious and staff great to talk to without being intrusive . The ambience is just amazing and if you want steak go and enjoy !
1	"We had dinner here our first night in Boston. The pizza was amazing, it had an amazing amount of flavor but wasn't greasy at all."
1	First time been here literally we round the corner of the restaurant but we went today to this place the stuff is attentive and the food is so nice definitely worth visit…
0	"The service was awful, the food was cold, and the building was hot. Definitely a waste of time and money."
0	"Don’t accept to stay if it is too busy , we had the worst service I think it was because they were too overwhelmed with customers , but I really expected better service , better organizing, they need it , though the quality of food is perfect , but  bad service"
0	Very expensive. I don't know how the price corresponds to the food.
0	"Don’t ever go here!!!!!! Worst experience of my life. Food nasty and our waitress pressed us about a tip. Out of all her tables who of course didn’t look like us, we were bullied to increase tip."
1	"The experience begins as soon as you enter the room, one of the most impressive dining rooms I've visited. Two tasting menus and an la carte are available. Everything was perfectly cooked and well presented. Very enjoyable evening."
0	My wife got food poisoned after having Eggs Benedict here for lunch some weeks ago. She ended up in hospital next morning. She had only had a coffee earlier in the morning and no dinner as she was already feeling sick at night. I tried to reach them throu
0	"I visited this place on saturday evening: only 2 table were occupied. As I entered no waiter was available in the restaurant and I went as far as the kitchen to find one. The atmosphere was cold. The service though quick was very basic and it seemed the waiter wasn't interested with his customer. My steak was ok but the mush potatoes were dry and tasteless. No bread was served nor offered. I was looking forward to a nice dinner with a nice steak but I found myself disappointed. For sure I don't recommend this restaurant, although from the outside looks pretty nice."
1	"The 14 course or even more was just mind blowing. I couldn't have imagined this to happen again, from daulat ki chaat to samosa to galauti to crabs to shikanji and what not. Do dine at the restaurant to experience the same"
0	"very overpriced for the quality. The strozzapreti were a low point, not handmade, not strozzapreti and tasteless truffle. And not al dente. How this got a Michelin star is incomprehensible."
0	No taste & very bland. Not sure If they have a new cook or what but we are sorrily disappointed. This food really has no taste.
0	Just a hec of a lot of food with little flavor…Bloody Mary best part of the meal.
0	"Nice ambience but the main courses were disappointing, and they arrived one hour after we finished the starters! We had Pasta, Puzza and meat. The meet was super dry. The pizza was undercooked."
1	Pleasant staff and beautiful scenery.=======We were on the big island again and couldn’t wait to go back. The staff is so helpful and friendly. This time we had a few drinks and hac the Rocks Poke and Fish Tacos. They did not disappoint… fresh and delicious. We’ll see you again doon i’m sure.
1	Amazing atmosphere. Discovered the art of food presentation from a different planet itself
0	" The food was good, but the service was really poor. The waiters started serving one plate after another without even let us taste the food, speaking too fast explaining the plate. One even laughed at us because we weren't eating the soup in the way it was supposed to be eaten."
1	"Food was amazing, really tasty and portions are more than enough."
0	We had shellfish cross contamination that sent my son into an anaphylaxis reaction and has to go to the ER - they handled it horribly as we'll by delaying our departure asking for the bill to be paid - it was awful!
1	"Fresh, handmade pierogi's- some classic, some with a modern twist and amazing flavor combinations. Their pumpkin pierogi's are now on the list of one of the best things I've ever eaten- paired with a sauce carefully recommended by our server. Highly recommend this place. Even locals told us to go here! "
0	It not worth it for the money. The coffee shop doesn't have bathroom.
0	"Food was extremely late, and served cold because the staff didn't notice it was sitting on the counter. We had to wait 45 mins and then we were only served after we asked about the delay. We had to send food back because the pasta was cold and leathery. Portions were small, staff was uninterested and disengaged, do not recommend. Price was not good value for money. This is a shame because in the past this used to be a good restaurant so the drop in service and quality is very disappointing."
0	Pizza tasted like burned cardboard ...I expected great pizza and was very dissapointed ...
1	No bread or desserts with pn/tn allergy Food is excellent
0	 Unfortunately the food and environment have deteriorated to the extend we will not be eating there anymore. On a positive note the staff are very friendly and helpful but unfortunately cannot make up for the poor quality of food and the worn and tired looking seating areas.
1	"Very good , food great , service excellent and location great also."
1	We went in unplanned based on a high percentage of “Indian” looking customers. We were not disappointed. Food was lovely; service great.
0	Hyped for no reason ! Hopeless staff and service. Don't know what's the attitude is for .. Very very Poor experience
1	Excellent food and service. The waiter Hakan was very polite and friendly! The ambience inside the restaurant was great and the music was eclectic. Highly recommended if you’re in the Galata area of Istanbul
1	"Amazing burgers, onion rings, California turkey melt and veggie sandwiches. (Don't get their locally made diet cola...the fresh iced tea is much better.) Great atmosphere!"
1	"Definitely going to book again.. Good prices, good food, good service what is not to like?!"
1	"I just want to say that the Bacon Bourbon Cheeseburger is one of the best fast food burgers I’ve ever had. There’s only been a few moments in my life where I’ve wanted to leave a review about something, and this is one of them."
1	Really cool place. The staff friendly and smiley! Food tasty!!!! Amazing decoration.. Clean!!! Definitely you should visit!!!!!!
1	"Last day visiting London and needed a bite for breakfast. Devine exceeded all of my expectations: excellent food, service, and price. I wish I would have stopped in earlier so I could have visited multiple times. Hope to get back to London and Devine soon!"
0	"My husband wanted so much a club sandwich for an early light dinner. The restaurant was more than half empty but the waitress, arrogant and snobby, wanted to seat us in a dark unpleasant corner. We say: no thank you!"
1	"Found this restaurant just a few blocks from our hotel and got a table without having made a reservation. The staff were very friendly and the food was great but I was particularly fond of their Dunkel Bier brewed on the premises, this was definitely the best of the whole trip."
0	Avoid this place like the plague their floor ruined my loubs still waiting for the director to contact me months later I have contacted the right people who are now going to investigate as i have witnesses who were dining that night and also find it so unprofessional how they can just ignore me and all emails will be taking this as far as I can go so unprofessional service is a joke and management are worse
0	"Heard that this was one of the most famous chicken rice hawkers in Singapore, but I was quite disappointed. The boiled chicken is tasteless, each serving comes with a few tiny slices of cucumber, and the rice (which is supposed to be fragrant and praised by international chefs) was hard and not fully-cooked."
1	this is the place to go. The staff here is beyond efficient.
0	"Dropped by on Sunday for a brunch and had to wait for over 15 minutes before anyone noticed me (while one of the servers laughed and chatted with his friend). Can't comment on the food, but the other customers and I have given up and left the establishment after about 15 minutes... avoid at all costs!!"
1	The service was excellent and our waitress was lovely and could help us enoug!
0	Must say was VERY disappointed with the Paella. Found the atmosphere nothing to talk about. Wished we had researched other venues. The service was nothing to talk about . My personal rating is 2
0	"Had to queue up for 15 minutes to get in despite having a reservation. Served the wrong drinks after a 35 minute at table. One meal arrived 15 minutes after the other 2 and was cold. Couldn't be bothered with desserts as there was no organisation, not enough staff and poor customer service. Needs better management and better training for servers."
0	Nothing was fresh and the waitresses and waiters were horrible.
0	We ordered a fairly expensive bottle of wine and the way it was served was more like you would except a one star restaurant to serve it. Waiter was poring it as if it was water and not wine . Sides are huge and not very well balanced with respect to how greasy they are and really salty
0	"We've tried this restaurant 3 times now, hoping to experience what people are raving about. Unfortunately, the 3rd time was not a charm. The nachos (which look great in the photos) are the worst nachos I've had. The layer of sliced deli cheese congeals within minutes leaving all the chips at the bottom dry. The tart guac, dry carnitas and flavorless salsa don't help the cause. The margaritas are good but that's about it."
1	"Very pricey, but like most Michelin restaurants, you are paying for the experience. We had the chef's choice menu, which was supposed to be 4 courses but wound up being more like 7. Excellent food and service."
0	There was a horrible smell inside the dinner to and the food was no better. The burger and fries I ordered was cold the burger was so hard I could even bite through it and my partners steak was horrible it was so small full of fat and she couldn't even chew it.
0	Disgracefully bad
1	"This place just makes happy. Everything is delicious. The amazing crunchy tortilla chips, salsa and guacamole is a must. Margaritas are great. And always get it ""Nicks Way"". The food has been consistently mouth watering for YEARS!"
1	What a lovely place at an excellent location. The food and coffee is delicious and the service is superb. The ladies are very nice and welcoming
0	"Party of five adults w reservation for 7:30 pm.Appealing menu. Very noisy. Server had to shout in order for us to hear her. We were not able to talk across the table, so we left with apologies and went to Bar Boulud across the street"
1	"This restaurant was a great find, off a quiet street in a lesser known part of London. Expect exceptional small plates of Israeli food, using in-season veg and excellent cuts of meat. The wait staff were efficient, knowledgeable and never intrusive. Fantastic!"
0	"Walked out after 2 lots of chicken wing starters were served with stone cold center of the meat, attitude of staff not good either. Avoid at all costs in my view."
1	The manager came to the table. He double checked some things with the chef. He was able to get the Ham with the sides switched to French Fries. They found a safe sauce for him. The serving size was huge and he really enjoyed everything.
0	I'm curious about the people that this house is delicious. First disappointment in the fried rice that has cooled down. 2nd disappointment of the cold Mapa Pieruesa. I left it all in the same chunks of sugar and left home
0	"They were able to accomodate me, but the dish that they brought out bore little resemblance to what I had ordered. When they have to alter a dish so much, I prefer a little warning. "
0	1. Hot food is fine 2. Limited you can order 5 dishes every 600 seconds. 3. Not sure it is real salmon & tuna 4. I order Salmon roe sushi but the serve Tobiko sushi
0	Service from start to finish was not good.
1	"Superb food, great service with special thanks to Sarah for serving my meal and making it such a lovely gastronomic experience. Beef was super juicy and tender!"
0	"just a terrible service, they don’t even know what they have on the menu, I took a picture name of the drink, they did not accept my takeaway( to go )order because I was without a car."
0	"We the worst experience ever! My family came to visit from Switzerland and was very happy to take them to a place with good food and nice atmosphere, but we had neither good food or nice atmosphere! "
1	Lovely restuarant filled with natural light. Service was very efficient and unobtrusive. our server was lovely and attentive without being overbearing.
1	Such a wonderful experience from start to finish. Very attentive staff throughout our time at the hotel. Thoroughly recommend and hope you come back again soon.
1	Wow the food was amazing -so much for the value and the service was excellent ! Thank you so much!
0	But I just received terrible service!
1	What can I say? I adore this place! Great atmosphere and great service! They are enforcing to wear masks which is what I feel safe. Our waiter was very kind and professional. Very attentive! They have the most delicious pizza!
0	"Service was a mess. No organisation, food going to wrong tables. At the end you get your food and it was not good. Pay the bill, and guess what they tried to rip me off also :( Sorry to say but I am not going back"
0	Food was bland & warm not hot. Tasteless really. service was great & staff very nice & friendly. Wouldn't return
1	"Great setting on the Kona shore, mahi mahi tocas were delicious, drinks were nice, service was good. Definitely recommend."
1	Very pleasant place to dine in and spend time with your friend or family food I so tasty quality and quantity is satisfies.
1	An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.
1	"the crabs were amazing!! the wait was a bit long but they have a telephone alert system that works pretty well. what can I say, the crabs were amazing."
0	Very strange policy.. Fine dining restaurant but Children are Not allowed.. Do you Guys have a licence of fine dining restaurant Or PuB Or what.
1	This is a nice little place. Order all your food at the bar then have a seat on the patio and the food will make it to you. Reasonably priced. While I stoped by this place for a quick bite alone I can see this would be a good place to hang out with some friends and have a couple beers. The Fish tacos had some kick to them . Very good.
0	Extremely poor service. Didn't get our clam chowder and salad until 65 minutes after our reservation time. Mediocre food.
0	"This was not a good restaurant at all. The guy was really pushy and the drinks and food were not good. The ""sparkling wine""....I swear it was Sprite."
1	"The experiênce was sublime.a big compliment to the Pastry ,that terragon ice cream was the best of the whole Europe trip."
1	Great meal! Use open table and make a reservatiion well in advance.  Waiter was very aware of cross contamination issues.
1	Unforgettable place! Fantastic peking duck near the Forbidden City. The place was very crowded but very glad we had the patient to wait. Truly worth the wait.
0	It used to be one of my favorite places but last experience was terrible management didn't care at all about it.. how sad!!
0	Came for a bite to eat at 3pm (on monday) but kitchen was closed? Why? Especially if you advertise as the only pou on sloane street? Only reason you get 2 instead of 1 star is because the lady in the bar was grand.
1	"The food was delicious, whilst the staff are so welcoming and cannot do enough for you. And, just like in Greece, shots with the bill! Good value too."
0	This is a total rip of don't even think of entering this restaurant the prices appear normal but the portions are so small that even a kitten would not be satisfied the quality consists only of frozen. Paid €34 to leave hungry and go to another restaurant to get some food.
1	"Very delicious Indian food,Really a nice and cozy environment.Superb reception and service."
1	"I love Cafe Tortoni,i try to go there as often as possible,the place is incredible,like give a jump back in time.The people are very kind and very helpful and always ready to attent all the customers needs."
0	they need to do a better job at cleaning. It just had a dirty feel. And I am NOT OCD. totally disappointed.
0	"Wow, so sad to find out this place was such a HUGE disappointment. Cold pieces of chicken that were questionably cooked on bland rice. No lines, no wonder. I agree with another review stating that with increased popularly and demand must come increased responsibility to keep up the quality. This was so bad, I didn't finish it and had to drink beer to wash it down. Carry on to Duck Noodle Oriental Stall, their braised duck noodle was amazing and washed out the bland from my palate."
0	"Very poor and slow service.. counteracts the cuteness of the place. Unsure if they are understaffed or the wait staff is incompetent. Been to this location 3 time now, and have consistently been disappointed. The one in TriBeCa is 10x better."
1	We came for our anniversary and Beata was our waitress. She was super nice and funny. An added entertainment to our night. The food was yummy and perfect for a good meal x
1	The truffle au jus with the steak was next level good. The seafood dishes were all very good. Delicious flavors all around.
0	"Food arrived after an hour waiting. Part of the order had been forgotten.Fillet steak when served was ""cold"" on the inside. Not going back!!!"
0	" Poor quality too. Nothing authentic. Just a thin, runny, salty liquid and barely any veg at all. It was nearly 400rp too. Terrible value"
1	The best burger I have ever tasted. The people where very nice and welcoming! Highly recommend for families and friends!
0	"Food was great but service was terrible. Staff and management were rude, slow and unaccommodating."
1	Excellent food and service all of the staff were really nice and friendly we had the burger and steaks all of which deserve five stars for taste quality presentation and portion size we were totally full after our mains but had to try desserts
1	We live close-by and had been waiting for Mathura to open. It did not disappoint. It was completely delicious. The building is beautiful and has wonderful light. We went for lunch. We had three courses each and they were spectacular. I wish them every success.
0	Really unpleasant staff and poor service
1	"The restaurant is super cute, the food here is delicious, the view is enjoyable, and the staff is friendly. Definitely worth a visit!"
0	Disappointing seafood for a 1200THB+/person dinner
1	"Good breakfast and variable menu dinner, good prokest and nice service, good ambience"
0	"We had my birthday breakfast at Mon Ami Gabi. The restaurant had a good gluten-free menu, I am celiac so have to follow a strict gluten-free diet. I made my server aware and she was really good. We all received our breakfasts, which were lovely. I had just taken a bite from the toast and the server came over and said that it wasn’t gluten-free toast! I was mortified. The manager came over and apologised half heartedly. And said accidents do happen! Which was no help to me, that was my birthday ruined. I was very poorly that night and I am still suffering. The whole trip to Vegas was to celebrate my birthday with family and friends. Safely to say I won’t be visiting this restaurant again. The other meals were great and were enjoyed. It’s a lovely restaurant with a great atmosphere. Recommend it, but not if you are celiac or have allergies."
0	"Was hustled in here by the guy who hangs around outside with the promise of a lunchtime meal deal. Do not listen to this man. Everything costs money. Amazed they don’t charge for napkins. Don’t even look at the water on the table. I had easily the worst dhaal I’ve ever eaten, completely tasteless, my girlfriends jalfrezi was also, somehow completely tasteless. Amazing that a restaurant with some much competition on Brick Lane can get away with serving such bad food. AVOID!"
0	I ordered a Philly cheesesteak and the thing was not edible.
0	"The people that work here are extremely rude and need to focus and their customer service skills . It’s like they don’t even care about the customer. Would go elsewhere for pizza , there are to many choices to choose from to put up with the service."
0	Lunched today and just about OK. Lovely people running the restaurant which is clearly popular with locals but certainly one we wouldn't rush back to.
0	"We wondered whether to go in because of the really bright lighting, but of course decided that you could not rate a restaurant on the lighting. Service was really nice but a bit chaotic and the food was really average- we ordered a pasta dish with aubergines - the aubergines didn't come and when we enquired about it the writer said the aubergines didn't taste nice so they had left them out! My arabiata was pretty lack lustre, although the portion was good."
0	"When it comes to meat and fire, any one can do it. The pros make the experience worth the down side to your health and heart. This place poorly cooks inferior meat, joins it with soggy fries, soupy spinach, but great service. If only those friendly waiters had something worth eating to serve. If you are not mindlessly grazing and take your eats seriously, seek meat at reliable and well known locations in and around NYC. Do not waste your cholesterol intake here."
1	"Great food, great view and great people! Highly recommended!"
0	The worst service we've ever experienced in a high end steak restaurant. We had one server - no assistants - and we waited at least 10 minutes after seating to have our drink order taken. Our food was horrendous. We ordered the surf and turf for two - thinking that the lobster tail here in Boston would be fresh and scrumptious! NOT! They were the same twin lobster tails we would have been served at an Outback back in Tampa. Certainly not worth the $150.00. We did not have a good
1	Everything you could ask for going out for an American dinner. Extensive menu. Squeaky clean place. Good decor and lighting. Extensive menu for food and drinks.Reservations not required.
1	A hidden gem where they severed a great pizza which was pretty delicious And they have the creamiest cheese cake ever!! Super friendly staff
0	"Fine, I get it. You're a tourist and you have to go to that place that sells a kanelbulle the size of your head because everybody's going and you just have to try it as well. Let me save you some calories and a disappointment: it's not the best kanelbulle in Gothenburg, and not even in Haga. It's the biggest one, the most famous one, but if you care about what you eat you will look the other way and say ""not today, kanelbulle. Not today.""And if you're smart you'll try something else or even better, go to a place where they sell kardemombulle or Stokholmknot and order one of those next to your drink and you'll know you have just beat the system and that you're better then everyone and that's just how it should be."
1	"Great wine recommendation, excellent starters and blue steak. Brilliant!"
1	"I was thete as part of a corporate event. Excellent small eats, a good space to mix in and efficient service."
0	"Extremely poor, arrogant and snobby service"
1	One of the best pizzas we've ever had. So crusty and delicious. We went Bleecker on a food tour and it was great. We will definitely come back.
1	" ood is stunning, both the tapas and downstairs restaurant."
1	Good food and price is good too.
1	Great spot for work meetings. Casual but friendly and professional waited service. Coffee and pastries are good. And the chocolate!!
0	"Worst experience at any restaurant, period! I will never return. The treatment by the staff should have been our first clue. Upon receiving our food, we were harassed by what seemed to be “regulars “ that had taken over the back of the restaurant. Do not go there!"
1	"Fantastic Afternoon Tea experience when we went towards end of Oct. The staff were very helpful and friendly, everything was covid secure and it made us feel safe. The food was great and they made it a nice little surprise for my wife's birthday which was a really nice touch. Thank you to the manager and the two staff members that made it a lovely afternoon 😊"
1	"Great atmosphere, and one of the best Indian meals I have had! Highly recommend going here for a lovely dinner, be sure you are hungry as the meals are big!"
1	Lovely curry place one of the finest in brickand the waiter Tuhin and joy and rahul was top notch definitely comin back to this place
1	"Great experience all round. The food was divine, couldn't fault the service, waiters very polite, friendly and professional, the whole atmosphere was fabulous"
0	Horrible. I could have cooked better. I have nothing else to say. Would have been better off at McDonald’s.
0	Reservation required. A place with few seats.
0	"We got a 50% discount offer from thefork, the restaurant in essence halved the quantity of food, and overcharged on drinks that are not on discount (a beer was charged for 6.5 GBP). In addition, they told us that dessert was unavailable (possibly avoiding discount on that item). In addition, the staff was rude and asked us to pay quickly and leave. "
0	Coffee is ok....better than most in NYC.....though a little too weak (even when ordering a double shot latte).  The real problem here is the acoustics are terrible......met a colleague to catch up for a quick chat and even sitting at the corner table was impossible to hear each other so bailed pretty quickly.
1	"They got my order right and even though there was a long line, the service was fast and efficient. What more can you ask of a fast food restaurant"
0	"Once a neighborhood star, now just a tourist ripoff. Rotten service, inept manager, just sad, a poor decline...too bad they don’t care, and it shows."
0	"If you book this restaurant by phone or have a Groupon voucher you will be booked in the restaurant next door, The first you will know is when you arrive to find it closed and are advised by the usual touts outside the Bengal Village next door that they have the same owner and that the kitchen and food is the same. It is not. Curry Bazaar are still selling a Groupon deal so be aware you may not be eating in the restaurant you booked and , as happened to us, they will not recognise the voucher until after a long discussion and contact with the owner. Quite sharp practice. After all that the food was poor to mediocre."
1	"Kind staff, cozy place and delicious burgers!"
0	"Pushy waiter, food was bland and Luke warm. We had to send it back."
0	"2 stars for the dry-as-dust, chuck-full-of-bones bbq chicken I ordered last night! Boo."
0	"I went to have dinner with my family and still regret. The service was from the beginning rude, and the food terrible bad, cold, tasteless, incredible small. No wonder this restaurant offers deals in Letsdeal.se..."
0	"Terrible chicken wings; old, over cooked and dry. Don't waste your time or money. Local mom and pop places are much better and really want to please you. This chain is so done"
1	"Old traditional restaurant serving local Serbian food which you won’t find in other restaurants. Food is amazing, but also the service and atmosphere. Great recommendation!"
1	"There was a long line, but the brisket noodle was worth it. The spot is crowded and they rush you in and out quickly. Still, good food."
0	"Go for the atmosphere and have a coffee but no food. Food is very poor quality and overpriced. It was like eating food from the 1950s before North America discovered European cooking. The tango show was second rate with the dancers going through the motions of a badly choreographed act. Spend your money on Esquina Carlos Gardel tango. Now, that is fabulous!"
0	"Everything is completely wrong, the treatment, the food. Oh god, pay so juicy for it NO THANK YOU Not even anyone who cared when we complained, You think you should get what you pay for"
1	Nice food and service. I had prawn bhuna and my partner had chicken madras both was natural and shot was tremendous
1	We had a jolly evening last Sunday having tried a range of both vegan and meaty plates. We also drank a remarkable white wine - Binyamina Gewürztraminer. The waitress whose name I never asked for (I only know she was Italian) attended to us with highest standards of professionalism and friendliness. I shall definitely return soon.
1	The best pizza I ever had! Really nice ambiente and good service too.
0	"We came in on a sunday evening and were seated at the bar and got the menue but we were not able to order because we were totally ignored by the staff for over 10 minutes, although we tryed very hard to get their attention. Then we left because we were treated that way."
1	"Food is great. People give amazing service. Treats u like family. Nice and clean. I always come and I have never been treated differently. The menu and prices are very good. The food is plenty. And that Michael Jackson is bomb! I know u will enjoy. And if there's a mistake, Charlie will make it right plus more."
1	"The food has ecxellent ingredients and flavors, nicely served Dishes are partly Indian and Nepalese"
1	Food is great and typical. Normally tourist Hotspot.
0	This was our only bad dinning experience in Kailua. 30 mins and our order had not been taken. The place was not busy and appeared to have ample staff. Very disappointed.
0	I went there with my family. It was my new born daughters b day. They did not let us to go inside bcoz we had a baby. I have dined in finest restaurant right from Japan to England....I have never faced this disrespect for babies.
1	Good! restaurant for local cuisine. Nice ambiance and good service. Reasonable and affordable price.
0	"We walked Brick Lane trying to decide on which Indian restaurant to choose. We were between Monsoon, Masala, and Eastern Eye. We went by Eastern Eye and the guy outside told us 20% off and 2 rounds of drinks. We continued to walk. We went into Masala but there wasn't a table and the free wine was gross- Penfolds! So... we decided on Eastern Eye. When we went back and went in, the guy that tried to get us in said 1 round of drinks, not two. It was a bait and switch."
0	How much salt can a chef dump into a goulash? Apparently Hofbräuhaus has attempted to find out. Easily the worst meal of our trip so far.
1	"Top 3 pizzas I've had. Top 2 Napoleon pizza I've had. The sauce is *chef's kiss* and the dollops of mozzarella are perfectly spaced. They have a spicy olive oil that adds a heavenly kick to the pizza as well. The inner crust is thin and cooked perfectly, and the perimeter is fluffy. Can't wait to come back!!"
1	"We try and come every first week of October. This time we made an early reservation and were seated by the open windows, which was great. Wait staff was great. We ordered some things we hadn't tried before, a starter with truffles they're famous for and an fish entree we hadn't tried. The starter was brought out by Marc himself. Experience very enjoyable."
0	"Such attitude!  I'm hoping it was just our server on that particular day, but he was definitely NOT knowledgeable nor did he seem particularly interested in trying to help us figure out what our dairy, egg, nut allergic child could eat there.  He would not check to see if there house-made chips were fried in dedicated oil nor did he offer any alternative sides since all of their side offerings were deemed unsafe.  When I suggested that I select a small bowl of fruit from the salad bar to go with my son's hotdog (the only thing on the kids menu that he could eat, sans bun), he charged me for the salad bar.  We will not be returning."
0	Very DisappointingI specifically ordered a medium-well rib eye cut and ended up with an over well done steak. You don’t expect such an amateur flop from a so called professional steakhouse in NY.I showed the burned steak to the waiter and all got from him was a sorry face.I was expecting at the least to have the manager or the Cheif showing up at our table and apologising for such a mistake but regrettably the final bill is all what showed up at our table.
0	Never experienced such tasteless food on a Michelin restaurant before. In addition the waitresses were unmotivated.
0	Not up to the hype. Limited menu and blank taste. Kasmiri mushroom dish is the worst
0	"I must say that I was not impressed. Our Parmigiana di Melanzane was lukewarm, the cheeses (Tagliera di Formaggi Misti) were rubbery and uninteresting, the Spaghetti alla carbonara was watery/milky and tasted like there was some kind of Aromat/bouillon cube in it and my Cannelloni al Forno (although hot as opposed to the Melanzane) was kind of anonymous."
1	Right in central Cannes the location can’t be beaten. New York has a wide range on the menu with fast service and good cocktails. The baked Camembert with gig jam is amazing! The place is not “authentic French food” but then again it’s New York New York. I’ve been many times and never been disappointed.
1	"Great food, I tried the 4 dish combo and it was amazing! The beef roulades with leek and garlic was my favorite! The service was top notch!"
1	The restuarant has made its way to world's top 50 restuarants and it clearly lives up to its reputation.
1	Dangerous place for chocolate lovers.  Their hot chocolate is literally like a cup of melted chocolate.   Maze of cacao products line the walls of this tiny cafe.  I'm in love.
0	Not recommending
0	Poor service: Hostess didn't seem to care that I had made a reservation (no name or anything asked). The poor waiter had to check the menu (in front of us!?) when we asked him for a pint of bitter. Food-wise you pay 10 quid for a mini burger and some chips. Thank you but next time I'll walk down to chester road to a less pretentious pub for some real stuff
1	We had a lovely experience here. The service was amazing and so was the food was honestly the best pizza I’ve ever had
0	"The service is terrible we had to ask the servers about 6 times if we found order food and then when we finally got to order it we got served separately so 2 of us had nearly finished before the other 2 people got their food. When we paid the bill we got up to leave and one of the women that works there with long blonde curly hair ( such a rude person) came running after us with a waiter accusing us of not paying the bill luckily we had paid with revolut which shows the payment straight away, no apology she just walked away. Definitely not worth a visit"
1	"Even though we didn’t reserve a table, the staff was very kind and with a full restaurant they made us wait while enjoying a beer. The food was delicious. We ordered schnitzel and Spatzel."
0	"The cafe and bar are old and interesting but that's where it ended for me. The food was very disappointing and the tango show was over priced and not so great. Other venues offer better packages which include pick up, dinner and show for much better value. Worth a look at the building but eat somewhere else."
0	"If I could, I would give this restaurant 0 starsThe waitress was being very unprofessional and disrespectful. UGH, it felt like a prison... save your money on some better service."
0	"The crepe looked fine, but the chicken looked store bought, pre-cooked and dry"
0	Very disappointing. Serving staff did their best but the restaurant had taken in way too many people resulting in extremely slow service. Meals were served at all different times so we could not eat together. I was also disappointed with the amount of potatoes and veg served with the burnt salmon! By the way we as a family never complain but this was ridiculous
1	"A really nice restaurant. Excellent attention, well attended by the waiters and the owner, a delicious menu, super recommended, we come from Colombia and it was our best restaurant experience in Istanbul."
1	"Food again was superb! Yet just again it was served slowly, while the staff were super friendly. One thing I really found problematic was the indoor air pollution—smoke from the ki "
0	This restaurant claims you must purchase starter main and side to get taste card discount. I informed staff we were using taste card but wasn’t informed of “their rules” till I asked for the bill.... to be honest even with the tastecard the food is very average. After arguing the point we got 25% off....
1	Excellent view for dinner or lunch Friendly and helpful staff with great views I would highly recommend this place
0	Trash no flavor at all.
0	"Very overpriced place and probably the worst service I have ever experienced. The manager was very rude and impatient with the customers, almost exclusively interested in our wallets. We were charged 85 kr + service fee for a bottle of tap water (that's almost 10 euros!). I have never seen this before, and it's revealing about the way customers are treated in this restaurant. The food itself was mediocre. Stay away of this place, there are plenty of other options!"
0	This was my first visit to this IHOP in 4 years and it was absolutely terrible! I understand the current staff shortage but the service was diabolical. The server brought the wrong food to the table then kept us waiting for ages for everything. The best part of this IHOP is leaving. I am usually a big fan of IHOP but this is one to avoid
0	"I would like to share my bad experience there..I went there in new year 2012 with my girlfriend.The menu for 175 dollars/pax (tax excluded) was very poor..just a small first course,a second course,some vegetables and a choice of one cake...and the free bar until 1,00 o'clock could not justify such a poor dinner with this price..and they even cheated us charging 70 dollars/pax for tax and tips (I should decide the tips not them!).We payed for 2 persons 451 dollars (so 31 dollars more)...And when the day later (because in new year you are relaxed in your perfect restaurant and you don't expect such situation )i explained the situation sending email to manager...she disappeared and not answered ..before dinner she was so kind to clarify all our questions..In conclusion..nice place ..but dinner not good and poor for this price..And be cheated..not good experience"
1	"Had to wait 20 minutes for getting a place on a Wednesday night. The food was worth it, flavour of the food was delicious. Loved it."
1	the coffee is always good and the $5 meal deal at the moment is hard to beat.
1	Very tasty burgers with equally tasty fries. Even the veggie burger (moving mountain) was excellent.
1	Great place! Best burgers! Awesome pizza all at a good price
1	"The service was wonderful, the food was excellent. The set menu was more than generous but they still offered to bring extra portions of anything we wanted."
0	"One of the worst Christmas menu I’ve ever had at duck and waffle! The turkey was dry AF! Could barely swallow it. Carrots where burnt, which chef allowed it to come out serve deserve to be fired, plus whoever came up with the Christmas food selection deserve to be publicly name and shamed. Will never go back for the Xmas day food"
1	Nice people with perfect service. Very tasty food and nice view in the restaurant. Price is OK with such nice food and service.
0	Paid Thai was disappointing. Coconut soup was ok.
1	Consistently is key and Tian Tian nails it. I was here a last year and it tastes exactly how it did then. Love how the chicken is so damn tender and juicy. I worship we had something close to it here in the Bay Area!
0	"You need to order online , so you feel less of a restaurant , we order sushi and nothing was special nothing where unique … it was disappointed , maybe if you order something else , it’s better"
1	Fantastic food and service / all staff including Sam and manager- looked after us and made us feel like we were the only people there despite being busy.
1	"A very nice place to visit and the staff are very nice and kind and the best in Dubai specially Zayne , cool place to hangout with friends and family"
1	It's really amazing place and they have a nice sea food and other food so cool best perfect I would like to come again best favourite to be my place too visit again so soon
0	Staff placed a wrong order for our table and still tried to shoved it to us. We said no and she was like “you don’t want it even if it’s given to you for free??”. HOW RUDE?! Food was average and we were served only 1/5 of the duck shown to us... Pricing was on the high side. Overall nothing fantastic and will definitely NOT be back again
1	Lovely restaurant! Perfect for a date as it is all sharing food. The taster menu was delish and came with surprises and was great value for money! Would defiantly recommend and go to again!
1	"Fabulous tasty fresh food. Would definitely recommend and wish to visit again. Friendly staff and service excellent , we had the daily specials."
1	Great food and service ty Daniel; Sandy beach floor; great view of sunsets; 'live' music; whale sightings; get there just before 5pm and avoid rush; you can stay at your table for two hours; take time ordering to enjoy sunset.
0	"Don't fall for the fake hype. They must print off their own 'Trip Advisor' banner each year because there is no way this restaurant serves the best curry on Brick Lane. My friend negotiated a £12 deal which included drinks, starter, main, and rice, however, cheap price = cheap quality. The rice was dry, curries bland, re-heated and so tasteless. No spice. Even the drinks tasted watered down. Unfortunately, I would not recommend this restaurant."
0	I went there for dinner last night with my family. This restaurant is overrated and overpriced. Service was fine but food was terrible and portions were quite small.
0	Horrendous!!! Ordered 2 sandwiches at 1pm eventually delivered at 2pm after chasing 3 times. Eventually apologised and allowed off charge. Understand hospitality struggling as in same industry but very disappointed
0	Massively overpriced for a bland meal!
1	"The food was delicious. It was our very first time at Indian restaurant. Very welcoming atmosphere and Ali took care of us and helped us to pick the right dishes. If you’re in marylebone and fancy some delicious Indian food, we would suggest you coming here !"
0	"I never thought discrimiation was still going ....until i went to this place for the second time....after having a lovely evenining with the founstains of th Bellagio..and the waiters yelling to each other in either langunage for tip....i tried to go to the toilet....big surprise....no toilet insiede....so i was asked for my credit card as i i was a robber....they lost me that moment...even Mr. Manager...San Hlawek, who i wrote him today, was hartful...they passed my card right away....lets see what next week await apart for RACISM"
1	"Took my kids this morning for breakfast and got right out on the patio! Even with the February chill we were nice and comfy under their heaters! Adorable place, wonderful and attentive service, and fab food. Two in our party had waffles - do not sleep on the blueberry with cream! Eggs cooked to perfection, raspberry jam for our toast was so yummy. Coffee and cream comes in these adorable little cups and mini pitchers. Highly recommend. This was one of our nicer meals but nothing that will break the bank, with gratuities we came in around $75 for three of us."
1	Bought as a buyagift offer - fabulous food and the service and staff were wonderful. Couldn’t do enough for the customers. We weren’t rushed at all and would recommend for a special occasion.
0	"Service awful, food even worse. the point is they are so slow with service this places always looks crazy. Don't go in unless you want to be disappointed and let down. There are so many great places to eat in Nerva you need to avoid this one."
1	"Lovely food, drinks and service! I recommend a visit, you won’t regret it."
0	Abysmal service. Food took ages to arrive and served sporadically. Food and coffee arrived cold. Staff unable to match any food to the customer. Complete confusion. The quality of the food that did arrive was underwhelming. Complete rip off - we should have refused to pay. At least have a number for each table so that confused staff are not walking around trying to find their correct table. It's simple really. Extremely poor all round and won't be using again
1	The place is beautifully decorated  The Turkish breakfast experience was truly memorable! I would definitely recommend this place!
1	"Very relaxing decor with lots of plants and greenery, a welcoming atmosphere and comfy chairs, the menu is great for fresh safe salads, pastas, fresh juices and Nepali classics too."
1	I love that you get a lot of food as well for the price.
1	" we were not disappointed as the portions were huge, coffee was constantly topped up and service was great. This is a very authentic place and great to visit"
1	"This restaurant is so good to the extent that i would only go back to Amsterdam just to eat there. My husband and me ordered 2 curry dishes and naan bread and it was simply delicious, the best curry we have ever tried. I totally recommend this place if you are a fan of Indian food."
1	"This buzzy restaurant, right off the Rue d' Antibes in the heart of Cannes, serves great food, with fast service and friendly staff.It gets really busy at peak times, so be prepared for a wait for a table.My favorite choice there is beef fajitas, which is a huge serving and hard to finish!"
0	"We wanted to have a small lunch and a Beer /Wine . Ordered a starter for all of us . We selected "" toast skagen"" from the meny a SEK 145:- . Two Beer and one glas White (SEK 145:-) . The starter was really a starter .The smallest we have ever seen . We had to wait quite some time and the waiter was really arrogant and had a lot of friends he had to talk to just visiting the place . Greedy , bad and expensive ."
1	Food was fresh and wonderful.  We loved it.  Only open for dinner though.   I wish we had this place in our town.
1	Fantastic service and amazing food! The only place in London where you can get very good quality herring on black bread. Will be back for sure!
0	We ate tonight a dinner for the first time which was ok. But when we ask to leave and pay as asked to take the remains of our meals. They simply threw us boxes and said do it yourself. So rude. I said they need to box it then the got very aggressive. My wife suffers anxiety and then had a major attack as the servers shouted at her. I gave them my name and address and said deal with it tomorrow then they simply threw us out. Awful service and awful response to customers. Some lovely chaps helped my wife with some water outside as she got breathless. The restaurant did not care. Luckily I videoed the whole thing and will upload it to youtube. They are arrogant and would never eat there gain. Try Bombay Spice next door as they are much nicer people!!

Salad had no dressing, and was deconstructed, but didn't say on the menu it was a deconstructed salad. Honestly, who deconstructs a salad????"
0	"It looked a lovely restaurant. Most of our food was good but the waiter made a mistake and ordered Salmon for our daughter instead of Lamb. She definitely ordered lamb as we discussed how it would be cooked. The salmon was sent back and 10 minutes later the lamb turned up. It was raw, this was sent back too and we gave up. When I queried the bill at the end, the waiter insisted the cold side dish of vegetables my daughter ate should still be charged. It wasn’t the cost, it was the principle. He argued that he would have to pay for the mistakes out of his wages. My daughter was made to feel terrible. I took the whole matter up with the manager who was extremely apologetic but it was frankly too late. The poor behaviour of the waiter ruined our evening."
0	"We had 5 courses, one was good the dessert, others either really nasty or ok. Sorry but all fish served was the type one would use for catfood or bait, cheap with bad taste.Even the coffee was bitter.I expected more from a Michelin starred restaurant"
1	This place is a must if you are staying anywhere near Kona. The food is amazingly fresh and high quality (recommend the poke bowl) and you can't beat the view. Highly recommend.
0	"Having been recommended Atlantic Fish we were keen to try this restaurant and had high expectations however that faded as soon as we walked in the front door of this restaurant! Firstly we weren’t greeted by anyone because the staff were having a conversation amongst themselves (not the best first impression) then eventually when our waiter did take us to our table, he left the menus on the table and left without saying a word?! My husband and I both had long coats on due to the weather and at no time were we offered for them to be taken to a coat rack, we then waited a further ten minutes for our drinks order to be taken all the while our waiter was looking all around the restaurant and didn’t once engage in conversation or talk to us about the menu. Eventually after some time of waiting we ordered our food and when it did arrive our waiter called Glenn who must have been on a cigarette break came back stinking of smoke which is extremely off putting and totally unprofessional put down our main courses and left never to be seen until the plates had been taken away and we asked for the cheque! My husband had the scallops which were burnt and some were raw and I had the swordfish with mashed potato and crispy Brussel sprouts which was truly awful! The swordfish was dry, the mashed potato was lumpy and cold and the sprouts as you will see from my attached photo were burnt to a crisp, there was absolutely no finesse to the cooking here at all! We did address this with Glenn who told us we should have told him sooner and as I said to him we would have if we knew where he was as he kept disappearing! At no point was an apology given, albeit my main course was taken off the bill however we’d rather pay full price and enjoy our evening! I would never return here and I will be telling my friends who work in Boston not to return as the standard of food and service was awful!"
0	" No, now I stop eating at this shit place. Worst service, worst food."
0	"The food was tasty, but we had to wait 1,5 hours to get our main course. We didn't get any apologies or compensation for the inconvenience."
0	"It is being 11 months since I can for the first time to Kodawari Ramen and from that day I became a client. We used to come in couple or with friends or family and it was always delicious. However, yesterday we decided to come when the restaurant open in the evenings. Arriving at 6.45pm there were already 11 people before us waiting for the restaurant to open. We entered at 7 and we ordered immediately and the waiter was not very friendly, he did not like that we told him that we Kew the menu and the system... then we saw how all the tables around were served and we had to wait 1hr to be served. As a client in the restaurant I know that normally the services is fast and when the food finally came they did not even apologise for the delay. On top of that my Ramen has all the vegetables and the chicken cold so it was not very tasty to eat it. We were really disappointed I do not want to come back and I will tell the truth about what happen to fiends and colleagues..."
1	Wonderful Peking duck Superb quality Consistent quality Cannot be missed item
0	"We researched this place on Trip Advisor and went for a special meal on our visit to NYC as this was showing #2 on Trip Advisor. On arrival the manager welcomed us and was very friendly and warm. We were given a nice seat - though the restaurant was quiet. Once seated the staff were very poor, cold and unfriendly/uninterested. We felt that we were non-American that we were given the least attention. All our orders etc were took down like we were being sized up for a coffin. We have dined in lots of restaurants and if this is the number 2 (currently #2 on TA) then I fear for New York! The food is decent, not a number 2 standard in a city and we left feeling done out of the $200 we spent. It's far from romantic and I would urge people to look elsewhere."
1	"Food and atmosphere even better than my favourite Indian restaurants in England! And even better, lots of vegan choices!"
1	Amazing paella as always! It’s still the best beach restaurant! Simple and tasty! Highly recommend the prawns pil pil as a side dish!
0	Grossly undercooked initial effort was subjected to another round in the kitchen that rendered it inedible. Server and manager were largely indifferent to the stumble. If this passes as exceptional in New Jersey....thoughts and prayers.
1	"In love with new concept/design, I feel like I'm in a European cafe...whether I'm grabbing my espresso at the standing high-tops or having a sit down cappuccino with a colleague, this is my go-to place for my caffeine fix. The change to For Five coffee was a good move, much better and smoother taste.  Also doesn't hurt to mention that the new jean apron/uniforms are super trendy and fun!"
1	Delightful meal at the Cuckoo's Nest. The main course was rich and the wine flowing. Would recommend a visit!
0	"The chicken burger was terrible, the place was really busy so it wasn't that it was old, just bad. I'm used to chicken meat, this was more of a mechanically stripped chicken burger."
1	What a lovely service from Merkeb ! Thank you so much you made our experience extra special. Bra place & delicious food
1	Owners are from Nepal but very friendly owners and we were welcomed with a smile . I would surely recommend this restaurant as the food was very good and they served with a smile . Keep up the good job
1	Nice staff. Lovely dessert on the house.
1	"Always a prompt food service as well as decent coffee. Portions are a good size for the money, especially in an airport. I somehow have had Lorissa serve me on the last 3 times I have eaten there. She is incredibly polite and a really good hostess"
1	Food was good. Bartender service was horrid.
1	One of the best pastas ever in a very casual place with great staff and you must try the tiramisu on the end. Fair prices.
1	We attended this restaurant and are so glad that we did. The food was absolutely beautiful and so reasonably priced.
0	Went for brunch. Oysters were only ok not as fresh or as cold as they should have been. Bloody Mary's only so so. Pretty disappointing for the high price tag.
1	Excellent food and service Have been before and will definitely return
0	"to be honest their food was good but their service was bad if not disgusted, be careful to invoice it can you increase it without you realize. I ate there for 65 the one charged me for the 90 's when I asked why he told me that's the price"
1	"Whenever i crave for some sushi, i come here. Excellent taste, good service. Definitely come back for more."
0	"Rushed, food taste is no better than the food court, small size sushi, not fresh, agedashi tofu tasted bad, broth is bitter, bad service, expensive for what they offer.  Overrated."
1	The waiter we got was amazing and provided us with excellent service and a good fun. The food felt authentic and the drinks were good
0	The food is really mediocre. Don't waste your time.
1	Everything was great even though I had the steak and fries. The group wi was with all had seafood and nothing was bad good food all around
0	"Waiter Eric puts on a tip, which is self decided. Very unusual as service on menu says service is included and usually customer decides on the tip. Ruined the experience and in the end lost them business as we won't be back."
1	"Living in Chorlton for over 6 years it’s weird that I haven’t been here before. After tonight’s visit I can highly see it will be a frequent place for me and my partner to go. We was served by Makara (sorry if I have spelt that wrong) who was so attentive and gave us top class service. I ordered the Roast Topside Beef and also had two cocktails (see photos), food was perfect, hot and fresh and the cocktails were fantastic. My partner ordered the Margarita Pizza and also two cocktails, he couldn’t even finish the pizza because it filled him up that much, he made sure to finish the cocktails though . Overall 10/10 we will be returning on a weekday to try their weekday menu."
0	"Over Hyped. Decent food, Great Ambience. But nothing worthy of being an Michelin Star Restaurant. Or Maybe expected too much !!"
0	"Beautiful place but very worthless service. Staff mainly busy with themselves, zero interest or friendliness to guests. "
0	This is the grossest restaurant I've had the misfortune to try.
0	Service not good waited long time for to order . And longer to get drinks
1	"Pizzas in the restaurant are really good, very tasty. The tomato sauce can be a little spicy (which I liked). "
1	" The service and hospitality was amazing from the staff, but more importantly the food was authentic, delicious and great value for money. The fish meze was incredible and fresh!!!"
1	"The food was really good and the eggs taste fresh. Our waitress was very polite and prompt, I really appreciate that face mask were worn by the staff mad us feel better about indoor dining. The only complaint my mom steak didn’t seem like steak but other than that the establishment was clean and quiet. Nice place to eat any time"
1	"Great vibes all around … for brunch, lunch, and dinner"
1	"Great brunch! My initial plate came out cold, and the waiter was more than accommodating and getting me another. The mimosas were strong as well. Good vibes! Would definitely recommend."
0	The workers were great but I wish I could say the same for the food. It was terrible .
1	"Visited with wife, son, father and mother in law and food was excellent. Burgers were lovely as was the chicken fajitas. Staff were all really nice. Would visit again!!"
0	Only stopped for a quick snack but food was way below the very basic of fast food. Almost inedible which I did leave most of it. The most shocking was the staff attitude and rudeness - completely unbelievable - they should be shut down.
0	"Visited the café on November 11. Felt comparatively safe - door guard, cameras all over. In spite of all this, my bag got stolen from underneath the table while I was paying the bill. The staff was quite uninterested, did not want to call the police and made no sign of compassion or desire to help. Rude, in fact. We even suspected that the waitor was an accomplice."
0	I found a piece of gum at the bottom of my sangria bottle
0	"Very disappointed. We asked about our food an hour after we ordered. The server said the cooks were in the middle of it. She then came to the table and said the ticket was lost. Mistakes happen but being lied to is tough to swallow - oh wait, we had no food to swallow. She then said they'd start the food and give us half off. We had already been there an hour and a half. We left. I called the Asst. Manager and he said he told the server to comp the bill. Which is it? Half off or comp? Half finished cooking or lost ticket? Mistakes happen but being lied to is a disregard of service."
1	Always very tasty! Excellent pancakes with homemade caramel sauce. Classic Ukrainian borscht is fantastic as well. Love this place!
1	"Everything is so good the service is so good aswell,everything is made in house and the deserts are so amazing, they are very friendly and a good place to home with friends"
0	Bad
1	"OMG,those cheesy bay biscuits!! Could have stayed to eat them alone all night. We wanted to try a few things so shared a platter of lobster tail, shrimp,scallops etc with sides of seafood cheesy fries and dragon broccoli. All of it was so delicious."
0	"Waiter was absolutely the rudest person we'd ever come across in our entire trip in EUROPE. Didn't even want to speak to us after he realized we were american tourists... didn't even say thank you (merci) for our business. Come here if you want to pay 7 Euro for a coffee with milk and 5.50 Euro for a bottle of water. ABSOLUTELY AVOID it's not worth the partial view of the Eiffel tower at all. Definitely the low point of my entire trip to Paris, don't come here."
0	"It was definitely the most overrated sushi restaurant I've been so far. I've checked that iSamsi was inthe top ten sushi restaurant in Manchester and I don't know why. Prices are not too high but still, I expected at least decent food. Sashimi hasn't been fully cutted - we had pieces of fish still connected! How it's possible in sushi bar? Fishes had no taste. Green flower tea served in wine glass... Yes, it show's it's beauty, but it was really easy to burn lips. Someone could as well take care about interiors... It was my first and last visit in this place."
1	Wendy's pays attention to the guest. The food was both delicious and beautiful. The service was friendly and knowledgeable without pandering.
1	"Chef did come out to speak to my son dairy, and nut allergic.  The waiter was good.. when they were serving the food he came over immediately and noticed that my son's dish had the meatball (with dairy) and the meatsauce (no dairy)  and took it from the serving person before putting it in front of my son and they got a him a new dish.. luckily something that was quick. Overall a good experience, not as good as the first time"
1	"Starters were really delicious, the bread was amazing. I ordered grilled chicken with was actually nice, however I was not impressed with the Greek salad at all."
1	"Great place food is really tasty, staff is also great!"
1	The food is incredible! I can’t believe why reviews are so bad! I’m Italian and believe me food is amazing! Jay is funny and very kind I totally recommend!!!!
0	I had heard about the great pizza at Bleekers After visiting them and seeing how dirty the place was and experiencing the rude staff we left without ordering. It might just have been an off night but there are so many great places in New York it isn't necessary to subject oneself to a place that is not clean and has a rude staff.
0	"The waiter in this restaurant was very pushy and behaved rudely towards our group. The quality of the food was acceptable, but it was way overpriced. They also asked 10 euros for a bottle of tap water and the service charge was mandatory which we didn't know (not on the menu as well). Overall, this restaurant left a very bad aftertaste."
1	"Excelente foods pizza,like italy.....staff perfetto e molto gentille!!!!!very good choise ,,, go there and you will be very sodisfied..."
1	"This wonderful example of the cafe culture of old Europe in Buenos Aires is a must see if you are in the City. Great Service, great surroundings. Just enjoy!"
0	Food was ok but everyone at our table got overcharged. Waiter didn't seem to know what he was doing. The other two couples challenged the charges and got them changed. I challenged mine once and he brought a new ticket. It was still wrong. After the third try I gave up and paid.
1	"Absolutely delicious. They have a limited menu but what they have is expertly prepared and delicious. Would definitely recommend this place. Don’t let the exterior fool you, this is upscale dining."
0	when the brought us the bill it was completely wrong. Apparently for a different table and much more than ours.
0	3 out of 4 items ordered were the wrong items and we were charged for things we never ordered as an example i ordered a double with bacon and recived the smallest childs size single burger i had ever seen with a single pickle chip as the only thing on the burger. As for the fries they seemed to be more salt than potato and went into the trash as they couldnt be eaten
0	"DO NOT EAT @ Rainforest Cafe Menlo Park Mall !!! After hearing such wonderful things from everyone I took my Celiac and Ana TN son. The executive chef came to the table and took his kids meal order (cheeseburger no bun with applesauce). It arrived with no cheese (I ordered an adult meal & am GF/DF - They got me confused with his kids meal and held his cheese). This is not a big deal But his plate came with fries and when we asked the fry seasoning had gluten! If we didn't ask he would have become extremely ill.To be honest, we were a party of 11 & called ahead about allergies and had a reservation. Food took 45 minutes to come and was cold. With the error my son waited closer to an hour for food and we were all very uneasy. Not worth the risk at this location."
0	"7 plats commandés, 7 plats franchement mauvais. À fuir. Disgusting, don’t go there. Very expensive and bad food quality. A huge scam. Go away"
1	We had the best time ever service was immaculate I think this is the best red lobster ever everyone was happy polite and helpful I will definitely recommend this restaurant keep up the good work guys
1	"We were informed that the owner's kid has nut allergies.  We feel very safe eating here, and the food is delicious!!"
0	"This place seems to be very overrated and I was pretty disappointed. For the price you pay, I expected more than just an average burger and frozen french fries."
1	There really isn't anything to complain about. We had done our research. We knew what we came for - and we got what we wanted.
1	"After walking around Buenos Aires all day, I was looking for a place to chill and have a treat. This place is a classic. Love all the wood and stained glass and the dessert was awesome. I felt like I was a writer or poet! Cool place."
0	"Wow! Well I'm not sure how I would know how long you've been open...or what that has to do with your mediocre coffee....but a simple apology, to right a wrong might have encouraged me to change my review once I was done feeding my 14 cats. Thanks for proving my point....  Not only do you lack technique, You lack professionalism :/"
1	"Amazing service from lovely staff - all smiling - and sumptuous pizza. Great music in background too. Couldn’t recommend more, a must for anyone visiting Chorlton/ Manchester in general"
0	"Terrible restaurant (if you can call it that!!). Service was extremely slow. We were served our starter, but no plates to eat it!!"
1	"Great food! I ate the combo plate with lobster, shrimp, fish and calamari! Quite well served! Go for it! And enjoy the biscuits as appetizer!"
1	"My favourite place to eat in Amsterdam. Such good food, great staff, the location is fantastic and you have an open view on the Artis floor zoo."
0	"Sourdough bread - nope some form of white bread. Avocado , for some reason very little taste. Maybe they were having a very bad day given the number of positive reviews but after looking forward to going out for breakfast, we were sorely disappointed."
1	This place is the best place to get your burgers and everything I love this place
0	"While running an offer, staff should be clued up on what is on offer and what is available. Staff had to check 3 times what was on the set menu and when we asked for the sorbet, we were informed there was none. But surprise surprise, we got served sorbet. Mains were ok. Madras tasted like a masala so bit disappointed. Waiting 1 hour and 15 mins for our plates to be cleared and actually offered our desserts was an absolute joke. Especially when 4 members of staff look at the table and walk away. Drinks. If you are only going to have 1 rose on the menu, make sure you serve only one rose and not two trying to dupe customers into thinking it is something else. All in all a very bad experience at this place. I will never be visiting here again. From working in the hospitality trade for 14 years, I have never known service so bad. Avoid at all costs unless you like waiting 3 days between courses."
0	"first of all the women at the front desk was not bothered to welcome us at all. We ordered 4 pieces and they were already pre-packed after we open it they were completely smashed, the taste was nothing like pasteis so throw our 4.60€ in a bin. Overall all very disappointed and definitely not worth mention."
0	"Been to the laundrette a few times but this evening was disappointing. We had to ask to order. We also asked for water for the table to accompany our drinks, this never arrived. Upon finishing our meal, we sat for sometime and our plates were not cleared, although others around us were. We asked for the bill, which came with a discretionary service charge! We proceeded to pay the bill and the plates were still not cleared until we left! Poor service and very disappointing."
1	"Amazing views of Singapore's skyline, great service!  Enjoyed the wine parings with each segment of my meal. Definitely worth splurging on a great tasting meal. RSVP early if you want the prime dinner time slots."
1	"I would describe the decor of the restaurant as charmingly rustic. The food and service were fabulous. The wait staff was ready and willing to meet your needs but also left you alone to enjoy your meal. We had the truffle ravioli, sushi and shared chicken. All were good but I would not order the ravioli again as it is a small portion size for a $49 price tag. The other dishes were outstanding and a good amount of food for the money. The bar area is large and was very crowded on the Wednesday night when we were dining. You will need a reservation."
0	The chateaubriand arrived with the incorrect side dishes. It was for a different table. Ours arrived and it was overcooked.
1	 it does not disappoint although I do not think it is worth paying the extra to go beyond the 86th floor. Visited both during the day and at night and quite different experiences
0	"An authoritarian doorman bossed a pavement que before allowing entry into a cafe that offers little - except volumes of melted cheese . Menu limited but that doesn't matter as everything comes out pretty much looking and tasting the same . This place must have been special once , but not on 23 December 2015. The Service didn't add any positives to the experience."
1	"Wow place. High-end place. Been twice. Different cuisine, different style.Everything is very tasty. Try rum ball. Personal touch for everything. Courteous and well mannered staff."
0	"Hands down the worst food experience I've had in an airport. Awful service, awful food Despite being largely empty the staff seemed to mill around doing nothing even after you asked them for something. Food was expensive, cold, bland, small portions. Asked for the bill 3 times before they brought it over. No wonder his places are going under, I'll never eat at any of his restaurants again."
1	"It was absolutely phenomenal! Juicy burgers, thick bacon, and crispy fries. Amazing service and clean  restaurant. Loved it!"
1	Excellent food. Sercice was overwhelmed. Very friendly and helpful when available.
1	The rice is freakin incredible!!! Wow I was surprised just how good the dish was. I added the garlic hot sauce and that really took it up a level. Just goes to show you how good a simple dish of chicken and rice can be. Excellent food and glad I visited the Maxwell Food Centre it was a great experience.
1	Great place to grab a burger and refreshing drink. People here are relaxed and friendly. This place is more of an adult bar type of place so bringing a carload of kids while adults are trying to relax probably isn't the vibe people are spending $30 on a lunch for. It is a dog friendly place and everything on the menu is tasty. When things are in full swing they do have entertainment. Once again this is a laid back bar environment but would definitely pick something up to enjoy at the many parks close by. This place was worth saving room for desert. Great staff and satisfying food. They have salads so there is something for everyone.(children can make a place fun but sometimes dealing with other people's wild children isn't on my to do list)
0	"1st impressions as I walked through the doors, the deco was very nice and looking forward to this. Once ordered our 1st lot of food, the food was nice, however as we ordered more, most of the dishes tasted the same because most dishes had teriyaki sauce on them. The grilled options didn't have enough choices. Wasn't even busy and a member of staff gave us food which is supposed to be on another table. Overall for me, I liked about 5 dishes. This place is once a year or once every 2 years to eat here, then probably 3rd or 4th time visit, no need to come back"
0	"It took ages to get my order taken. After I finished my appetiser I asked for another water and it only came after I finished my main. I then ask for a dessert menu and have to tell a waiter I want to order. It's not like the servers were busy, they were all next to the bar socialising. I then decided to time how long my dessert took to get. From just after I ordered it, it took 12 minutes and 8 seconds. I had seen my dessert on the counter after 6 minutes. I work in the hospitality industry and believe this is unacceptable. For the check, how am I meant to sign the check without a pen?"
1	We had a late lunch. As starter we had tartare and spring rolls.The risotto was very good also the other ones. Together with the wine make it perfect
1	"Excellent lunch at Eastern Eye. Authentic Balti cuisine, amazing naan and great customer service.would throughly recommend."
0	Disgusting food. Poorly advertised onions in the sausage & bacon bap - DISGUSTING ... Why? Ham/cheese croissants not very warm. Coffee weak Exorbitantly expensive!!Would rather buy a two day old cheese sandwich from local garage!!
1	"ice views, good food and nice atmosphere"
0	"Was top rated pick! Brunch menu was tiny, drinks overpriced, sad bloody Mary, eggs Benedict overcooked I would never eat again, not at all a good experience. The the best thing about it was across the street Bellagio fountains."
0	"Style over substance. Weird, sassy, service (""thanks for joining us"" told to someone from our group who was barely 10 minutes late, a waiter actively enquiring as to why we didn't follow his suggestion... If I'm not interested in your lamb chops, I'm not, don't pressurise me. An item forgotten - then offered for free at the end), EXTREMELY overpriced food, check out the size of the aubergine... For £11?!? That's nothing short of a scam. The food was essentially a rip off, £21 for a piece of octopus. Flavours were alright but nothing breathtaking and doesn't justify the extortionate amount they charge you for it. All of this, combined with the sassy service means we won't go back. You want to try a good Israeli/middle Eastern restaurant? Go to Berber & Q it's MILES better."
0	"50£ minimum spend per person at the bar, insane. They will keep the deposit if you do not spent 50£ at the bar"
0	"Their service is good, but the food is not as good as I thought and their price is a bit high."
1	"Came here for an anniversary meal, our server carlo was absolutely brilliant so kind and helpful everything came very quick but also tasted very fresh and lovely. Will definitely be visiting again when we come back to London."
1	Nice food and great service but very empty at 5.30. Some items on the menu not available. Otherwise good. Would go again
1	This is my second time and it did not dissapoint.
0	Very noisy - couldn’t hear what people were saying across the table unless they shouted.
1	Great staff and great food. The place was lively and had great service. The setup was clean and i got my food in a timely manner. The food (as usual) was spectacular!
1	"Book this table in advance for a great view, unique experience and lovely food. Felt like your own private restaurant!"
0	"Tables that were too crowded and that were too small, only eat standard food several times because the place was too cold. Disaster not recommended"
1	This is a stunning restaurant in old town.
0	"Sat there for an hour whilst people coming in after us had food; spoke to the manageress, only to find the kitchen had lost our order. Was promised it would be straight out....sat there another 10 minutes then walked out. Middle of the tourist district, so also expect it to be noisy and be very crammed in."
1	Window seats with glorious evening viewr over the city. The food was excellent and the staff delightful. A very nice experience!
0	I ordered a 22 euro bottle of wine. They brought me a different one and charged me 42 euro. A rip off. Food is average.
1	Very good food especially the vegan menu! Also the place is a very Ancient South-Asian giving vibe for the people who are into rich culture.
0	"I wish there were more of these cafeteria style places around. No need to wait for a waiter to come and take your order. Go put it in yourself, pay for it, find a spot to sit and enjoy. Only problem is it could be hard to find a table to sit (people like to linger) and as usual avocado toast is ridiculously over priced (but I still buy it every time)."
0	"My 7 year old son is football mad so thought this would be the perfect place. Unfortunately it’s quite dull even for a football fanatic. The kids menu is pretty dire-meatballs looked microwaved and were the smallest meatballs I’d ever seen. We ordered burgers; they were greasy and lacked flavour, I didn’t take two bites out of mine before I asked for a refund. Have genuinely had better burgers at McDonald’s, which is saying something. We didn’t bother ordering dessert as the food was so poor-we didn’t want to waste any more money. Service left a lot to be desired, the staff looked mostly bored and unapproachable. Definitely not service with a smile!! They add a tip on automatically as well, I would have asked them to remove it as they didn’t deserve it, but couldn’t face waiting another 30 minutes for it to be corrected. I don’t agree with automatic tipping on principle, as it totally demotivates staff to offer a good service, which is clearly the case here. We all left quite underwhelmed. I wouldn’t bother taking families, I’m not sure it’s really meant for them-although, I’m not entirely sure who this place is for???"
1	Awesome food. Excellent covid regulations.
0	Don’t stand in line for a cafe that is 100% indistinguishable from any other early 20th century cafe for burnt coffee and over cooked medialunas.
1	 Little Forest encapsulates the very essence of what food is about – locally sourced produce cooked to put a smile on your face.
0	"This is about the Mc Ds at Times Square New York. I thought I would try it for the second time in two years but its still grubby, greasy and horrible. Not sure if anything ever gets cleaned. Would not recommend it just for health reasons alone."
0	"The waiter was beyond rude ,the food came oils cold finally we got bill and mentiooned was cold and waiter was rude and aggressive saying why we eat then "
1	"Small place, outstanding food, soo delicious !"
0	A café in Haga with a large selection of pastries. Unfortunately it is quite expensive and what we ate just tasted sweet.
1	"Really good, innovative, yummy food. All dishes were beautifully presented and almost looked too beautiful to eat. Great selection of your a veggie too. Highly recommend and the service matched the quality of the food. Excellent and will go again, and again, and again"
1	"What a wonderful afternoon spent in this amazing restaurant. We all had the Ribeye, so tender and full of flavour! Great wine and food selection, and service was very tentative. My friends and I want to make this gorgeous restaurant our place for lunch once a month. "
0	The rump steak was rather chewy and nothing special really..I expected better as I've always wanted to ty steak on a stone. Rather pricey too
0	Nice atmosphere. Worst service in Dallas. Save your money and time at the bar. The bartender's are only interested in trying to pick up women and the valet staff are supper rude. Been 3 times and will never go back.
0	"The staff was friendly, but the service - from taking our order to bringing the food - was truly terrible. It took ages to get someone to take our order; two of our three starters and one of our main courses were never delivered. No explanations or apologies were offered; that's just the way it was, the food just didn't come. We'll remember it, but we won't repeat it!"
1	"The staff who served us were all so lovely and friendly, very helpful with explaining the menu to us, if you're nervous about that as a tourist. We had two different burgers and they were both amazing, along with amazing dessert and wine. Very reasonably priced, would absolutely recommend!"
1	The food was amazing and the restaurant was beautiful. We had spectacular service Ellie took great care of us. Portions are on the smaller side so when I ordered the homemade tofu with gluten they brought my a half.
1	We have been a few times and always enjoy the food and the service is fab
0	"Very kind and friendly people, from corporate to the wait staff. While they were wiling work with my food allergy, they admitted that the chance of cross contamination was extremely high. They use the same grills for both cheeseburgers and regular, and the same fryers for wings and mozzarella sticks. I'm extremely sensitive so I choose to just enjoy the beer instead. "
0	Food was not very good. Service worse.
0	"I went to Bala Baya in November to celebrate my birthday. Initially I made a call with them in October to reserve my table and on request to have a complementary cake to celebrate as a treat. I spoke with a work colleague, Ola stated that would be fine without mentioning any fee. Little did I know that £40.00 was charged for the cake on top of our food which my friends and I were all shocked about. I spoke with the manager Michael who was not professional and very impolite about everything, demanding that we pay the £40 for a desert that we thought was a birthday treat. He then mentioned that every celebrant who brings a cake at their restaurant will pay £30 on top. I don't know any restaurant that charges you to bring your own cake! The food portions were very small, cold and my friends and I paid a lot for it. The service wasn't as I thought it would be and I would not recommend anyone going to this restaurant to eat. Please do not waste your money as Bala Baya is deceptive. I will be taking up this matter further. "
1	Great food!
1	Aaaaammazing. Just ask the server what the most popular things are and order those. There is one sandwich in particular as small plate-- to die for.
1	"Great food, amazing staff speciallyNanette and Flora they were the best, the bar staff were very nice and were very knowledgeable about the beers and wines and spirits also had the pleasure of meeting Seema who done an amazing job with the housekeeping."
0	"Very sad. I was attended and went to lunch. I paid the 209 Dirham bill. However, I handed over 300 Dirham and didn't get the change. Something totally disloyal and dishonest. I returned to withdraw the change and they refused to return it. This is a shame."
0	"Good service and nice people, but the food was unexpected with the price, and i found a lot restaurants have a good food more than this restaurant. i won't back for that restaurant"
0	"Negative. Everything is okay, food and coffee is nice, the staff at the cafe are the rudest, compared to people you are used to see at Swedish cafes. They take orders as if the customer is begging for service, use really unfriendly sentences (such as ""here is your order, remember that coffee guests cannot sit at a table with a fork and knife"". Can't you express that politely?), they don't know proper English and register wrong orders. This has happened to me twice. Come here if you can deal with this manner!"
0	"floor supervisor annoying. Noisy and cramped, very little space between the tables. Food quality is average as expected"
1	"Enjoyed the pound of Snow Crab Legs, very much, as well as the Butterfly Shrimp, and popcorn shrimp! Very reasonably priced, compared to all the other seafood places around. Great server as well."
1	"I loved the grilled pizza, reminded me of legit Italian pizza."
1	They were very willing to accommodate our severe allergies
1	"There is something for everyone here. Most extensive Asian menu I have seen. Great food, huge portions, super friendly and fast service. These guys got it figured out."
1	This is a small cafe with excellent food and top notch friendly service. Went for breakfast and had the best English breakfast. Prices are excellent with great food quality. Was there on my visit to London and recommend to all who visit.
0	he food was too dry and not so tasty
1	Super friendly and accommodating young lady behind the counter. Delicious pastries and coffee. GREAT selection of chocolates and other desserts. What more can you ask for???
1	Made a special trip here to try some donuts which were great! My nut allergic daughter was in heaven.
0	There was no reservation on arrival There was no social distancing Management was rude Plates were dirty Food not authentic as advertised All and all not a great experience We left after our starter
1	We had a great meal here. They were accommodating to our family with 3 young children. Staff were attentive and friendly.
0	"After being in New York for a few days, it was my mission to find some really good NYC pizza. I walked past this place with my wife and she said hey look it says the best pizza. I'm a fan of marketing, so I hopped right in. First off the place was packed, (which I think this must be a great place then). When I got to the register the guy serving starts yelling at me asking what I want. Now I met a few New Yorkers already and I must say they are good people, so when this guy starts yelling at me for no reason I was shocked. I ordered my pizza and then left. Rude service. Now for the pizza review. It looked so good, just mouth watering. I took my first bite and grease just came pouring out of the pizza. That's all I tasted. It had no flavour, just grease and a pretty face. Sad to say but my best NYC pizza was at the airport getting ready to fly home. Avoid this place unless you enjoy servers yelling at you and pizza that looks pretty."
1	Food was great and service was excellent. We requested the private room and the room was set up ready for us when we arrived.
1	"We went for the first time the other night, the food was amazing, affordable, and very accommodating for vegans and vegetarians! The staff where soo friendly, chatty and attentive, even with it being busy, lovely atmosphere, just such a nice evening, highly recommend and I will be going back many times."
1	The food was excellent. The service was super fast and the staff were very nice. We had a main and a pudding and both were incredible. The burger is the best I’ve ever had!
1	They're happy hours is the best... very good bartenders as well.. and their steak is to die for
1	"Great staff, moderate prices and nice location! The big ""kanelbulle"" was a bit dry but tasty anyway. I would definitely go back!"
1	"Came to this place twice during our stay in BI, probably the best place (vibe + food quality) in the strip. We went for happy hour once and it was great, laid back and very chill. The second time was during New Year's Eve where we had dinner. It was quite a wait but then the food came and it was really good. We ordered the Poke Salad and Bulgogi Fried Rice and I was pleasantly surprised with the food, so good! Our server (we didn't know the name :( ) was very attentive, polite and not pushy at all. Overall, would definitely come back when I'm in town."
1	Joy is extremely nice and helped us navigate the menu and find exactly what we wanted. It is our first time in London and because of that he gave us a beer on the house! Quite the lad!
1	"My kiddo has peanut, treenut, soy and then some for allergies. We LOVE Grimaldi's. We eat there just about every weekend. Delicious thin crust pizza in a lovely setting but most importantly, there are fabulous about accommodating our allergies. No nuts in the pizza or salads. They do a great job of handling our pizza with allergy precautions in such a kind, fabulous and responsible way!"
1	"Nice restaurant with nice wait staff. Some of the food we had was amazing, and some was ok. The view from the restaurant is very nice. "
0	"The service is terrible, took 10 mins to get the waiter to get our order. When the food finally arrived the steak was cold. Trying to explain to the waitress, she didn’t seem apologetic. This was truly one of my worst experiences. I’m never coming back. Good luck to the people who dare to try."
0	"Had high hopes but was really disappointed and won’t be going back. My family of 4 went. Firstly ordered drinks but they was left sat on the bar for ages even until after the food came when it was the first time ordering we had seen any staff to chase. Beer was then flat. Food was like something you would expect off a van at the match wasn’t great for the price. Asked for sauces for the kids - again didn’t turn up had to chase. Had dessert and was sat waiting again so much so had to get up, coats on and still had to wait at the door with the kids to even pay. Let’s the hotel down massively. You would be better off at Nando’s down the road which we wished we had gone to in the end."
0	"The restaurant is cosy and the food is good. Yet, the waiting time are, by far, totally unacceptable."
1	Would definitely bring my friends here!
1	"Forest & Plate has been one of the top restaurants in my list of all times. There is so much love and creativeness put into the plate of fresh salads, pastas and all the other dishes"
0	"Really looked forward to the visit, pre booked in advance, waited 45 mins after booking before sitting, bar area small full and very noisey .this is very popular but when our main dish arrived was rather tasteless. A plus is the staff were attentive."
1	Been here multiple times. By far the best pizza I’ve eaten in Sweden.
1	"Great place the food was good and service was great, but a very eclectic serve yourself place."
1	Great food comes from great people and our expert Chinese chefs are masters of the culinary arts. Their experience can be tasted with every bite you take.
0	"Shown to a table and then we were left for 20 mins ... no drinks , noting. Eventually “ Leslie graces us with her presence after we indicated that we would like to order. She took the drinks order and the food at the same time. The wine arrived but not the other drinks ( 2 G&T’s) after another 20 mins ww asked for our drinks again only to be told “ in 2 minutes” the food arrived and still no drinks so I said to Leslie “ where are our drinks? “ I wasn’t happy but I certainly was not rude. Leslie decided that she didn’t like me asking and became very very aggressive... said it wasn’t her fault it was the bar , how dare I speak to her like that !!! I have genuinely never been spoken to like that by a waitress. Her attitude was utterly disgraceful, arrogant doesn’t even come close. The food was good but my whole meal was ruined by the treatment by this one bloody awful woman. Never ever sit in the section !!! I’m so upset that it ruined my night"
1	"I love this restaurant. I went with a friend previously, and liked it so much that I took my family back there. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced, and its location i "

0	"Very bad pizza, no lemonades, only Pepsi , bad service , I will not recommended at all! Just the place that it's very old, Hola and take a pictures and eat somewhere else! Cafeteria food , and terrible"
1	"It's a small place but you get to feel a good ambience, service was great, waiters are polite and friendly, food was tasty! would visit again, so I recommend."
0	"Bigged up on reviews, overly loud, food was poor for an Italian."
1	"This always one of our favorite places to eat. Always enjoy eating outdoor, watching everything going by while eating good food."
1	Always love duck and waffle. For the views and the food. Top tip is to go either for sunset or sunrise.
0	Without a doubt the worst place in Dallas. No interest in customer service or return business. Mission accomplished!
1	Great atmosphere and lovely people with superb food.
1	Staff is friendly and attentive. Lunch menu has some exotic options which was OK and a bit better than OK. Prices are acceptable.
0	Food not good
0	Eating too expensive and not worth it
0	" I would never tell anyone to eat here, this place was nasty. "
0	"Very bad smell & dirty, the food was cold when we got it. Not to mention that the food took forever to arrive at our table. All the food was nasty, our fruit and salad was full of dirt"
0	"Basically, the chicken was soggy and tasteless, though the rice has shrimp sauce --a nice touch.  Would recommend to try the Hainanese stall across from it and the nasi lemak. Basically, don't just come because a bunch of pretentious fat French dudes said it was good, right?"
0	"Horrible food, gave me food poisoning. Also super expensive for low quality food. I don't recommend going here"
0	"the pad thai was really sticky it pretty much came in the shape of the box, only had 3 shrimp and had no flavor."
1	"A seaside location that can't be beaten.Sand underfoot and overlooking the bay, a particularly good spot for enjoying the sunset.Great food and beverages, plus friendly and attentive staff.A little pricey as you do seem to pay gor the location. Take advantage of happy hour, 3-5pm."
0	"We arrived for lunch early - around 11: 35 with three hungry children and four adults. A lovely friendly greeting and lots of space outside with great space heaters. However, breakfast was finished and lunch had not started. Sadly nothing available at all to eat so we went onto Moose who were packed with happy diners who could be served food! Shame as have been before and was quite enjoyable. No food at all? Surely the chef should be able to make an omelette or couple of cheese toasties any time of day? Chef needs more help I suspect!! Turning 7 covers away is not good for business and certainly very disappointing for the children!"
0	"Server Lorissa was very pleasant and good and patient, and kept us informed but was unable to serve any food due to the lack of availability. This is a poor restaurant experience and we are unlikely to ever return"
0	Wanted to go for dinner but all booked due to graduation celebration. Told we could in the bar if we came by first come first serve. No thanks. We'd rather not pay steakhouse prices to sit at a bar.
1	"very good service, quality of the dishes is always perfect. service really friendly and polite. we go sometimes for an aperitiv, the wine choice is large and we have been here for dinner in summer and in winter. there is nothing that you can not find. Prices are a litle bit high but you pay the location. Location, Location, location. eventhough it is very good.I can really recommend also the cafe gourmand."
1	Great atmosphere with a beautiful view of the ocean. The food was good and the drinks were decent. But I'd come back here again just for the vibes. 🤙
1	"I ordered the cranberry pecan sourdough bread loaf, which was warm from the oven. Delicious!! I also ordered an almond croissant which was the BEST I've ever had!! Highly recommend stopping at Izola to get some of their specialty bakery items. I pre-order and stop by when visiting San Diego. Call ahead to get yours!"
1	"ood superb, service superb, location superb - a fantastic night for a family party of 6"
0	We were really disappointed with the preparation. The cook have no idea of preparing the gosht. Just prepared a lamb curry with lots of oil and tomatoes. The tomatoes were not even cooked.
1	"We had a wonderful visit to this incredible restaurant. Please visit and be amazed at the delicious flavours, selection and service. Yum!"
0	"We waited in a long line. The service was poor. The pastais were even worse; eggy, lumpy and burned on the bottom. Skip it."
0	"We ordered Gypsy Place, which was given to us 3 minutes after ordering, so I'm not sure about its freshness. Plus they were too thick and not fried raw potatoes. And the price over £ 17 for one raw dish is a huge exaggeration !!! If the pancake is fried from long-grated potatoes, they take on a dark consistency, rather it may be not fresh and secondly, how can you bake the pancake in 2 minutes and add goulash and additions to it in these two minutes? You are fast or you have never cooked and you do not know that a cake of this thickness will not be fried in 2 minutes or just a cake was prepared earlier and waited for someone to appear and order. If you can't come with criticism then you should probably open this Chip shop for £ 1 and not restaurants because I don't smear, I just express my opinion because that's why this option on the website exists. You are mistaken because the plate was not returned empty. greetings"
1	Perfect Friday morning breakfast. Fast and happy service. Big breakfast for 100 kronor is fantastic!!
1	"Great food, Indian and international alike. Try the dosa for breakfast. Made to order, this is the quintessential Indian breakfast. The breakfast buffet is one the best I've seen. The staff are very helpful and attentive. The room I was in came with the breakfast and I enjoyed it every day I stayed at the hotel. The perfect place to start a busy day in Chennai."
1	 Absolutely amazing! The place is beautiful and staff are super friendly and the food is delicious.
1	"Amazing bread! And Jeffrey is so committed to his craft, we love Izola!"
0	I asked for a refund and was told it was a no refund policy.
1	Amazing service and food. Everything we ate was absolutely delicious. OMG the tomahawk steak was amazing!!! And the staff was awesome.
1	Had an amazing experience at Sushi Mami. The staff were really friendly and explained everything well on arrival. There was lots to choose from on the menu and food arrived quickly. The sushi was delicious and enjoyed every plate we had. Great value for money and left feeling very full. The dessert station was a nice touch to finish with too. The only improvement I would give is to include more vegetarian options on the menu e.g. veggie gyoza/bao/spring rolls etc. for those who don’t eat meat. Overall I would return and recommend for any sushi lovers.
0	"The food was very amateur, unfortunately. Not professional at all. And the price was very high. I can't recommend to go there. High cost for low food"
1	Great place to dine at. Great service and the food is the best
1	"It is a nice place in a good location. Never really tried and walked past always and turns out food, wine and service is really good. We liked almost everything"
0	"we were served by a grey haired woman with glasses who was extremely rude. She would never smile or offer any manners, and was very harsh. She even forced us into moving belongings around the table. "
0	"This place is absolutely overpriced and will leave you feeling like you got scammed.  As mentioned by others, the food here is terrible and if food is what you're looking for, you are better off eating from the street vendors. The Thai food I had in North America and Europe were much better than this."
0	"The food was not good, not even the hamburger in a country where meat is so good. The service was even worse and the manager just as bad as the whole experience. We waited for 30 minutes to get the waiter’s attention just to clear the table. I asked the head waiter for assistance and he was indifferent. I found our waiter and asked him what we had to do to get service and he said he’d be there and then walked away dismissively. Spoke with the manager and explained the situation. He apologized and still nothing changed. As we stood up to leave they came running with the check! Several people had the same experience. I rate them as 0!"
0	"The food here is disgusting, the staff is rude and incompetent and the store itself has a terrible environment. The only thing this place has going for it is its location at the park, but even that cannot compensate for its grossly exorbitant prices and awful ingredients. Usually I love supporting small businesses, but the owner treated his staff and customers so rudely it was unbelievable. All the ingredients are sub par; cheap deli meats, rotten/dirty lettuce mix, unripe/previously frozen avocado and slimy canned ingredients. For the same prices you can go across the park to Masterpiece Deli and have a delicious gourmet sandwich with quality ingredients like boars heads meats and truffle oil. Whatever you do don't waste your money here."
1	It is a very luxurious restaurant on the 53rd floor of ritz Carlton hotel with a fabulous view. The food is absolutely amazing and the customer service is unbelievable. Thanks to our host Anna me and my friends had a perfect night at this place.
1	"The food was a lot of seafood. It was very delicious. My dad's birthday was also celebrated with a surprise cake! Thank you MsPesr, Yu, Ying"
1	"We have been here many times and have never had a bad thing to say- well other than the fact that we ate too much!! The service is good, food is good, drinks were good.. Highly recommend!"
0	Very very bad quality. They fake smile to take your money. Almost 100$ for one fish with few French fries... Bad people. Bad food. So bad review.
0	"i placed my order like normal and i sat down. a few minutes later, someone brings the food but its the wrong order. so i told the dude that it was wrong and he got so annoyed with me and proceeded to kick my nan down the stairs. after that he shoved the mozzarella sticks up my left nostril and gallops away like a horse. unacceptable."
1	"Warm welcome and attentive uniformed waiters in this busy historic restaurant.Lots of locals using it so must be good!We were lucky but there was a queue waiting to come in when we left at 4.30pm.Do try the thick chocolate drink, it’s sooo rich! Lomo steaks good too."
0	"View spectacular, staff excellent, unfortunately food was not. Had lunch on Friday 16 January 2015 found the menu very limiting an even more so if only two people dining. However that would not have been so bad had we both not been physically ill an hour or so after leaving the restaurant. Have complained to restaurant but heard nothing further. Obviously would not eat there again but an acknowledgement would have been nice!"
0	Absolutely disgusting.
0	Cold reheated pizza. Bland flavors. Maybe could have been better if fresh out of the oven! Some of the $0.99 options around the city are unfortunately better. Good location and adequate seating options inside and outside. Expected a lot more based on other reviews.
0	"Service: Slow, inattentive, almost rude. Waited 2 Hours for a steack that was overcooked!Food: overcooked and dry steak for 50 dollars. Sides not includedLocation: very good locationOverall: horrible experience. It's definitely not worth the money.Don't go there. There are other places with better food and better service."
0	"The visit was not a memorable one. It is very crowded, the tables are packed in tightly to each other. The noise is so loud you can't hear yourself think let alone talk to who you're with. The food was over priced."
1	"I would highly recommend this restaurant, the food is fresh and wonderfully prepared in lovely comfortable surroundings. During"
0	The meat was not of good quality and har to chew. The dish was also without almost no seasoning.
0	"Really wanted to like this place as it was so close to our hotel and was well up for some Schnitzel after another day of Oktoberfest. Sadly, the food was disappointing as it was greasy and lacking flavour. The 3 of us agreed it was overpriced. A shame."
0	This has to be the worst red lobster we have ever visited ! It was situated 9892 International Drive. My husband ordered the $36.00 surf and turf and the steak was like shoe leather and the lobster tasted off with a very peculiar metallic taste to it . My daughters pasta was dry and tasteless and stuck to the plate ( very over cooked ) . My soup was cold and my main arrived with no mash potato and burnt veg. We have eaten at many an establishment through out the USA and this has to have been the worst ever. The worst $100 spent they didn't offer any discount or recompense . Avoid at all cost !!!
0	"the food was good, but the service was very bad. Arrogant and unfriendly. It felt like it was a privilege for us to being served."
0	"I decided to try some Japanese on my visit to Florida and found this place on Yelp. The place is relatively big, service was good but the food I should have ate at a Chinese take out instead. I ordered a Beef Donburi and the portion was so ridiculously small my 4 year old won't be full. My wife ordered the Sirlion Grill which looked like a McDonalds hamburger patty. The best thing I had here was water. "
0	"We went there based on the lineup and comments. I guess we dont like the same pîzza as the bostonians (or Sox fans). Not greasy as a pizzeria and not fancy as a fire place oven. It was dry, taste was so so. Service was VERY ordinary. IN summary, very disapointed and went to Mikes to get a cannoli. To each his own!"
0	"We were extremely disappointed when eating here.  The service was ok, the food pretty bad. "
1	"Taste of the foods was awesome and I had a really good time with friends. Jone was the one who taking care of our table, appreciated his services. Thumb ups !"
1	"our visit to the 102nd floor was an absolute highlight—not just because of the views, but because of Ranita, our host in the observatory. An Empire State Building employee for 25 (!!) years, she is clearly so dedicated to her job and making visitors feel welcome. Thank you Ranita for a visit our kids won’t soon forget."
1	The burgers are some of the best in Gothenburg.
1	"Sometimes it is VERY difficult to find a restaurant in an area where the tourists swarm all over. Even more difficult is finding a good restaurant in these areas that serve the typical cuisine of the region. Muncher Stubn definitely is an exception. It's across the street from the train station and an easy walk from the Marienplatz area but still offers a delicious array of Bavarian-style dishes. My wife and I both loved our dishes and their wine list had a tasty Gruner. And for those who speak English and no German, this wasn't an issue as their staff is multi-lingual and they had a menu in English. This was a delicious way to start our holiday in Bavaria (especially on a Sunday night when not all restaurants were open)."
1	"The Michelin star place offers some exotic food options. Located in the heart of Delhi, inside The Lodhi Hotel, this place is the best Luxury Dine in Experience one can get."
1	"You have the option of various cocktails, probably the best Pina colada I have tasted in my life. I will definitely be coming back here again."
0	Please do never ever stand in line to get a table there. There are lots of other great traditional coffee houses in B.A.We went there today for breakfast because of its reputation. We ordered a continental breakfast and churros-the churros were the worst I ever ate. Cold and greasy and they tasted as if they were lying around for a long time. Ruined my appetite for the whole day-stomach ache and so on. Breakfast was OK. Service was not great.Do not recommend.
1	"The restaurant also offers a wonderful drink menu, and they offer one of the best wines in the region."
1	"It required waiting about 30 mins on a Sunday. It is worth. It. It was cold outside so they could only use indoor seating; otherwise they also offer outdoor seating. The menu has many good choices. All four of us ordered the brunch which they serve for four ordering. It included bacon, sausage, quiche, donuts, French toast, fruit & cheeses, salad, etc. we accompanied with French pressed coffee. This was one of the best prepared brunch meals. Well done. They also have large TVs for watching sports and they had a live music guitar player; right decimal level; not too loud."
0	Went for food before a football match. Food was awful - beef burger and chicken burgers were all so unbelievably dry. The chicken wings we got to start were completely tasteless. If that wasn't bad enough we then got asked to leave early because they'd overbooked. Wouldn't recommend. The burger stand food next to it looked much better.
1	"We could not have asked for a better final meal on our trip to China. The view was fantastic, and the service, especially from our waiter, Johnson, was perfect. He expertly recommended the perfect amount of dishes and explained the history of each one."
0	"Substandard taste. I have been to quite a few fine dining restaurants, but it’s the worst . We have ordered chef’s tasting menu, which has erratic food course . Indian Accent is strictly average and very overly priced . A similar dining restaurant ‘ Masala Library’ is much better than this."
0	My experience was horrible! We didn’t have our vaccination cards so we weren’t allowed inside which is understandable however nor did we get a refund due to a 24 hour advance cancellation policy!All that money and did not get to a memorable experience.That was a horrible rip off nobody has money to just give away
1	"This place offers authentic Nordic food in a comtemporaty environment. Eat out to help out is still on here. Etke should make your shortlist for a classy dining experience. Great service, and even better effort and skill in the preparation and presentation of dishes."
0	"The staff is friendly, but I was looking for getting full against the price I paid. I got fooled by the reviews, and got terrible food, I had to go somewhere else."
1	"This was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had and I've had french food in Paris. The escargot was to die for, the steak was cooked perfectly and the banana's foster crepes for desert melted in your mouth. I ate entirely too much but it was worth the stomach ache! The atmosphere was nice and service was on point."
0	. I asked if the bagel was fresh (so that I wouldn't get it toasted) and the guys said yes. It wasn't. My friend got hers toasted and said it was ok. Don't get a bagel here.
0	Our waitress was kind and asked about allergies but she didn’t seem to understand why bread from “a local bakery” was being questioned. The manager came out and said the bakery did handle nuts. We skipped the burger my daughter wanted to eat and she ate a sandwich we brought. Good intentions here but not somewhere I’d go again with my daughter.
1	"We ordered a dairy, egg, peanut free ice cream cake from here. They showed me ingredients of everything used to make the cake. The owner also is very diligent about the whole process from washing hands to not even eating anything with peanuts if she knows she will be handling food for an allergic customer. They also carry chocolates that are allergy safe (top 8). Great little store."
0	"The interior of the restaurant and the vibe were the aspects that made us stay for lunch. HOWEVER, my friend and myself soon felt that the waiters don't have much experience. The order was taken in steps and we were left talking at times. When the main courses came, we still had the plates from the appetizer in front of us so the waiter was just looking at us helplessly. Once we finished the food we got the bill and every one minute somebody different would come to remove an item from the table. Yes, we did take our time, but the restaurant was not busy at all and up until that point we didn't get much attention. For a casual lunch the price should have come with much better service. The food was quite nice, but both main courses were really salty."
0	"The pizza was soggy and burnt. The place was noisy with loud bad music, and the service wasn't very good. Also, they charged us 10kr for a glass of tap water, which is a bit uncool. With all the good pizzerias in Malmö, I would definitely not recommend this place, get your pizza somewhere else!"
1	"We made the reservation on Open Table. com which allows you to indicate special needs.  I called prior to the reservation spoke to the hostess (manager unavailable) and she said they would have problem accommodating us.  when we arrived, allison, the manager came to our table asked us specifically about the allergies,told us what was safe, what was made in the shared fryer, told us she would go down and take a fresh piece of meat out for us and made sure the server was there to hear all of it. They did an excellent job and this is the second time we have dined here. Prior experience was just as good.  "
1	A busy and cheerful city centre Korean restaurant serving good Korean food. The staff are friendly and efficient. I will gladly go there again.

1	Dropped in to the Hyatt to meet someone. A pot of decent coffee (2.5 cups) in the lounge in comfortable and spacious surroundings £3.50! Why on earth go to a coffee shop chain!!!
0	"Most definitely the worst dining experience we have experienced. Should have known by the state of the toilets to leave immediately. The dirty marks over the doors leading to the toilets were shocking, the laque of hygiene shows, and the disabled toilets were thick with grime.... i wouldn't lay our child on the baby changing, who knows what would have been caught from the absolute filth. Food was shocking, a ton of salt added to everything... our children thankfully would not touch it. Didnt think you could go wrong with rice, clearly this place can. One of our party was sick after eating here, the rest of us wouldn't touch the food so probably explains why we were ok.Just avoid at all costs. Honestly not sure who is leaving positive reviews for this place, its filthy and needs a hygiene inspection."
0	"We dined here recently having booked for a special occasion and was really looking forward to some great steak but was left very disappointed with the quality of the steak itself.I ordered the 16oz fillet steak and requested this medium. My steak was over cooked, chewy and tasteless. It was under seasoned, dry and bitterly disappointing! For a restaurant in the centre of New York priding itself on the quality of its steak I was really let down and surprised by this.The sides we had were great and I had a starter of the thick cut bacon which was nice, but again nothing to write home about.Our waiter was excellent and as on as I brought the issue to his attention he offered to replace my steak, however I didn’t want all the food going cold and my husband to have to sit and wait too. He ate the remainder of my steak!The waiter also took my steak off the final bill which was a great gesture as he saw for himself the steak was over cooked. He then arranged a really nice dessert platter for us which I really appreciated, and I have to say the desserts on their were very nice.My second gripe however is our waiter then went home for the evening, he came over and apologised again for the steak and wished us a good night. We were then dealt with by another waiter who was incredibly rude! The meal was a wedding gift from my brother who had paid for some champagne for us and told us the meal was covered, we questioned this when he brought us the bill as we didn’t want to be paying for something that had already been paid for or have the restaurant billing my brother when we had paid. He was rude when he responded and almost implied we were trying to get away with out paying! We have since been in touch and saw the communications with the restaurant from my brother where they clearly state they would foot the bill for the meal. Again this was a disappointment on the restaurants organising.Our bill came to £97 in the end and due to the disappointment with the food, the waiter being very rude we didn’t feel the standard 20% tip was deserved here so left $13 to reflect the good service from our previous waiter. The waiter then brought us back out bill, pointed to the recommended service charge and said “I think you need to check you bill and look at the recommended service charge” whilst pointing at the money we had left!what a cheek! We then explain why we hadn’t left 20% to which he waved the money around and shrugged his shoulders, walking off mid sentence! Unbelievable.This and the steak ruined what should have been a wonderful evening celebrating our honeymoon. Wouldn’t visit here again and wouldn’t recommend this. It’s a shame as the place is beautiful, initial service was great, and the menu looks so good."
1	Really lovely family run authentic restaurant. Enjoyed all our courses and great ambience and servive. Would recommend.
0	Overall not good. When no tip was given due to all the above the waiter went into meltdown shouting and said that's the 'third lot tonight that haven't bothered! To me that says it all! Avoid.
1	It is in a nice neighbourhood. Has both indoor and outdoor seating. Food was great. service was excellent. People were chic. We ate and talked for a long time without being bothered. I highly recommend
1	"Thank for make it so easy. The reservation is so easy and simple. Even when i re-arrange it so easy. The ambience is so comfortable, and the food is 100% tasty!! "
1	"They were definitely a 10/10. If you are looking for an affordable restaurant with high quality food in London, this is definitely the place to be."
0	"Very unprofessional experience with Tyler, he is not very kind or thoughtful towards the elderly."
0	"The food and service were good, but nothing exceptional. I think it is a bit overpriced. Went there once... not twice."
0	As soon as they know you are a tourist they will jack up the prices. For example the price of two small crabs and 4 pieces of jumbo shrimp costed us 220 Turkish Lira and 1 KG sea bas 170 Lira
1	"Had an amazing experience last week after being hit with a massive delay, only had drinks but Kerry our waitress was Brilliant, highly recommend."
0	"Chef was annoyed to deal w/ a child's food allergies-even though restaurant was dead. Our daughter had a severe reaction & had to be treated. My husband confronted the chef, who admitted he didn't check all ingredients. He pulled out a book & egg was in the sauce used in her meal. Horrible. We are local, Annual Pass holders, DVC, & Tables in Wonderland & we will NEVER eat at downtown Disney again. "
0	"Poor service, gf options are not tasty."
1	This restaurant offers a perfect view over the lovely Gothenburg city. After dinner there is a great cocktail bar to enjoy variety of innovative drinks. Try the legendary shrimp sandwich.
0	"I decided to give this local steakhouse in my neighborhood a try for the first time last night. The decor and atmosphere was very pleasant.My wife and I both shared the bacon appetizer, which was average at best, overcooked and a little on the cold side for my taste. We both ordered filet mignon medium rare with sides of baked potato, sauteed mushrooms, and sauteed carrots brown butter and honey.The steaks we're overcooked, one being at least medium and the other at least medium well. I'm not sure how they could come out different when ordered the same way, and they appeared to be identical size. We decided to keep them anyway hoping the quality of the meat would make up for them being overcooked. Unfortunately, the filet mignons were nowhere near the quality you would expect in an average American Steakhouse. The baked potato was so overcooked and so burned on the bottom that we could not cut through the bottom with a steak knife when we tried to share it. The mushrooms we're very good but neither one of us liked the carrots, they also seemed to be overcooked and dry. Club A has the smallest wine selection I've ever seen in a steakhouse so we choose two glasses of a California Cabernet called Decoy which turned out to be very good, sadly it turned out to be the best part of the meal so I ordered a second glass.The restaurant was surprisingly quiet for a Thursday at 7.30 pm but somehow our waiter completely lost interest in us after he took our order and never once came to check on how everything was, even though he walked past our table constantly. Another waiter brought a complimentary dessert dish with three small samples but never offered a dessert menu which we would have liked. Is it possible that they don't have a dessert menu? I tried to get our waiter's attention to get some coffee or espresso and some after dinner drinks, but he continued to ignore us and we eventually gave up and just asked for the check. Of course when he brought back the check he tried to be pleasant by asking us where we were from, I told him we're from around the corner and he told me he's from Montenegro and left. He should have asked how was the food and service, it would have been a more interesting conversation. On the way out I mentioned to our waiter that we would have liked to have had coffee and after dinner drinks but he never came near out table and he just looked at me and shrugged like he couldn't care less.I'm not complaining about the prices here, it is Manhattan and we eat out all the time, but this is not a cheap restaurant and the food and service world not have been acceptable had the bill been half what we paid. Being, literally two blocks from home it's a shame that it was such a disappointment as we would be regular visitors if it lived up to expectations.Club A gets an F."
0	Horrible experience. Manager was arrogant and disrespectful when we complained the food didn't come how we ordered.
0	"On this occasion, service and food was not up to their usual standard. We were disappointed. Lack of attention to detail, order not going to the kitchen added to a disappointing evening meal."
0	We did not feel welcome and had it it not been so hurried we might well have ordered more drinks and a dessert.My wife was so annoyed she turned down a free Baileys. Majorly disappointing.
0	"I visited here with family and friends and pre booked 4 weeks in advanced when we arrived the manager was unapologetic and rude about messing up our booking and told us we haven’t booked. The staff decided to cram us in the corner of the outside area even though there were many seats inside. The food came quickly however the children’s meal came 10 minutes after, after we had to ask. In my opinion that should of come out first. Overall my experience was unsatisfactory and my family and I will not be returning again."
0	"However, starters were uninspired and mediocre, some of the dips tasting shop bought. Grilled fish was heavily salted. Grilled meats were very disappointing, of poor quality, and, for some reason, were served swimming in some sort of oily liquid. Curiously, the chicken kebab was the most successful of the lot. Kleftico was very nice, but was served, for better or for worse, with a concentrated tomato sauce."
0	"the food was very disappointing. I had the chicken, which was dry and came with a side of what tasted like reheated or heat lamp kept roast potatoes."
1	"Radjoot was a lovely experience! I am new to London and found this place through Tripadvisor -- I wasn't sure what to expect but it was an amazing experience.The upstairs is really nice, with a beautiful bar. The service was great (the other reviews are spot on about this) -- Ali asked us about the flavors we tend to like and then suggested dishes accordingly. He was spot on; everyone in my family loved their dishes. I also loved how he had the chefs cater my dish to my liking, even though it meant that they made it slightly differently than they usually would. My dish was the perfect level of spiciness! I absolutely loved it.Overall, had a great experience here. I will absolutely be coming back again and again!"
0	Not fresh
0	We were excited to try this place after seeing the reviews and the location. We gave our name to a hostess at about 4:50PM along with our phone # in order to get a text when our table was ready. The hostess was not at all welcoming and could not explain why we couldn’t have a seat at the bar while we waited. “The system is down” was the explanation. So we went across the street to Humpy’s where we were warmly welcomed and had a drink. Bottom line: we were never contacted by On the Rocks because the hostess got our phone # wrong. We had a wonderful dinner at Humpy’s!!! On the Rocks seems like they feel entitled and don’t care if you go there or not. So go somewhere else!!!
0	Service was absolutely terrible. Was made to wait more than an hour for food and then the waiter shouted at us. Utter disgrace. Stay away. Not worth it.
1	"As I entered this restaurant, it made me feel like I was somewhere in Europe with amazing vibe of this place. Food, staff and service it was all to the perfection. Great work"
1	"Staff helpful and friendly, very busy but kept attention on everyone. Food lovely and quick service, will definitely be back"
0	"Absolutely terrible. The woman behind the counter was incredibly rude, because I didn’t decide what I wanted within a minute or two of entering she told me to f**k off. I ignored it, proceeded to order and it truly was the worst breakfast I have ."
0	"It is my second time visiting with my husband. Should say the food is relatively good however, if you are planning to have a meal in a good environment and service, I strongly advise you to go somewhere else. Other people were complaining as well with this. If you are just looking for a place to have a quick meal by yourself, should be ok. However we won't visit this place again. Let's just say bad experience."
1	Really good burgers..and every burger can be exchanged for an amazing halloumi and mushroom patty!! Their truffel mayo is a must try!!
0	"The food was good, the prices were fair for the portions. But the reason I am rating this low, is because of the horrible service. I have never seen a more disorganized restaurant/terrace in my life. We waited for long to get our table, and then we waited so long to get our order through. They forgot to remind is the bar closes at 22:30, even though we wanted to order more drinks. The waiters need more training thats for sure..."
0	"After telling the wait staff repeatedly that I had a severe food allergy, they gave the usual assurances that they prepared the food correctly. However, they were obviously wrong- I reacted to one of the appetizers and ended up in the hospital. DO NOT recommend to anyone with severe food allergies."
1	"Overall, pretty good. I got the Mac and Cheese and had an excellent meal without worries."
1	Had a great meal - my kids loved it! They have a dedicated fryer for the french fries. The server was extremely knowledgeable. We avoided the vegan shakes because of the risk of cross contamination.
1	"My brother and I are in town for work and we always like looking for local cuisine. We found your place and it was absolutely awesome! I highly recommend the Spanish omelet with corned beef hash. I really enjoyed it. Next time I am in town with my wife and kids, we will stop here for breakfast!"
1	Very good service and authentic Moroccan cuisine
0	"Want to be greeted by surly “maître d's”, who go out of their way to make you feel that you are not trendy enough to be in their presence as they shove you on a table to keep you out of the way as they have made a pre-judgement about you from 10 paces out. Follow this with a “pot-luck-shot” with a waiter who is either a professional and cannot do enough for you (rare), or, like a “team member” of one of those trendy boutique chain shops is really only there to pose around and chat continually with other staff members in huddled groups. Then you need to go to New York, New York, Cannes. Once you have finally attracted the attention of one of the waiting staff who have been trained in the extraordinary ability to look over your head, or the good ones look straight through you. Rush you order with them as you are unlikely to see them again until the bill arrives and then they will fake the smile as they give you the bill, of course all written in French except for the extraordinary line in capitals and often pointed out by your “new best friend” that says in bold print TIPS ARE NOT INCLUDED. The irritated waiter when questioned about Service Compris has assumed that speaking English makes us tourists and rich and easy pickings. But don’t worry, any concerns you have had about your experience and issues can be swiftly dealt with by the owner who will nod and agree and do absolutely nothing. Despite having supported this restaurant since it first opened nobody will ever acknowledge that they recognise you (ideal for those people looking to conduct a secretive affair), but what keeps us returning (despite vowing never to do so) are the hard working kitchen team who continually produce great food and who do so in the face of a “team of front of house staff” who could not care less if they served you a bowl of gruel. I don’t expect any response, this really is a letter of last resort – but I will probably return occasionally for the chefs cooking. Instead I will spend my money (and lots of it) in other venues and tip staff who actually provide a service and not just lashings of bad attitude.I will translate this into French with Google, but will of course leave those immortal words lifted from the bottom of my bill from yesterday 24th July 2020, TIPS ARE NOT INCLUDED."

0	Worst food ever. Terrible service. It was a disaster save yourself and don’t go to that place. Change everything. Terrible sorry
1	"I've been to many and I mean many Wendy's, for their spicy chicken sandwich. This location right here hands down has the best. I know, I know how can that be. But yeah their always on point. If you've ever been let down by a spicy chicken sandwich before, you've got to come here and get one here. Trust me you'll be amazed! Get american cheese on it. Enjoy"
0	Extremely oily. Left half my plate untouched. My friend who ordered vegetarian food got a chicken meal. We all got our meals at different times. Overpriced for what it offered too. Would not go back!
1	"We had a wonderful food in the evening,and lots of seafood here ... different type of sea food ..and everything is fresh"
0	"Eaten here more than 4 times. This time it was the worst! The meat was lumpy after that I would get a new one, of course it is bloody then!"
1	A very tasty menu matched well with wines was what awaited me at this premiere eatery in Delhi. A well deserved Michelin star and with good merit.
0	Disappointing customer service. Had to stand waiting for over 5 minutes before someone came over to us. Had a table booked for 1:30 and were ushered to a seating area until 1:40 until our table was ready. Sandwiches were a little dry. Cakes and scones were tasty. Nobody came to check on us after our our food was delivered so no offer of hot water for tea etc. Just very slow and inattentive service.
0	he sausage was greasy and the potato’s were terrible. I’m shocked that so many people have written good reviews. We won’t be back.
0	Never seen such arrogance and attitude in the staff. They made us feel that we are not welcome - as if they are taking an obligation to serve us.. food was below average and certainly not worth the price they charge. pathetic experience. Will not recommend anyone.
1	"Eastern Eye Balti House on Brick lane is one of my favorites, I really enjoy the cuisine and really great service."
0	Street food- give up We went by the internet recommendation - we were very disappointed . street food Not very tasty. Does not make the effort to get there -give up
1	We went to this restaurant for lunch on the advice of the hotel receptionist as the service is all day. The menu is varied. The quality is there as well as the quantity.
1	All Food items was delicious specially mutton achari. Staff was very polite and quick in service. I happily want to come back with my friends .
1	"This food is simply amazing, tabletop BBQ and the staff is grilling the meat for you! This food experience will make long for more!"
0	Really disappointed. Probably the worst Indian food I’ve ever had (it wasn’t really Indian at all). The slip was pretty inedible. Overpriced with poor service. Go elsewhere.
0	"Went there for a friend's birthday dinner, fairly large group. Services was ok, but the food was not. The apps were so so, nothing special, and the sides were extremely bland. I would expect ""herbed french fries"" to have some herbs, but these were straight out of a frozen food section. Hard, no flavor.But the real reason for the review is their Ribeye. At $54 a pop, you'd think these would be cooked to perfection. Hardly. Both I and the person next to me ordered the Ribeye medium rare. No one else at the table did.Eventually, all the food came out, everyone else's steaks and all the sides. The waiters served everyone their food, and then went around handing out sides. Except for my neighbor and I. Our Ribeyes were nowhere to be found. We waited. And waited.It's pretty clear they plum forgot to put the order in, because 5-10 minutes after everyone else had been completely served, our steaks came out. And they were awful. Complete char on the outside. And just under the surface - purple. Ridiculously rare. As in cold. I always order medium rare. I know medium rare, and this was on the wrong side of rare. Both steaks were identical, and my neighbor had the same opinion.We literally had to send them back. I like medium rare, but I can't do straight from the freezer bloody. So they took them back. And when they returned, it was almost the exact same. More charred around the edges, same completely uncooked center.At this point my neighbor made what I considered a reasonable request - just start over. These steaks weren't going to work. The edges were burnt, the centers raw. The waiter mumbled something as he took them away.And when they came back, Club A had not in fact started over, they just turned the same steaks into hockey pucks. We now had well done steaks. $54 hockey pucks.At this point, my neighbor flipped his lid, rightly in my opinion. I suffered through what I could, but it was terrible. But I was starving, it had been over 2 hours since we had sat down. The steak did come off the bill.But for the price, in a place like NYC, where there's about a hundred high quality steakhouses, you need to do better. A lot better.By far the worst steak I have ever eaten. Will never go back. Why would I? Too many great steakhouses in the city. No reason to waste money here."
0	I expect decent when I go into a chain restaurant. We ordered light as it was hot outside and I felt like we offended the waiter by being there. The bread was hard as a rock. The waiter ogled over my infant daughter which was just a bit much. She's not your entertainment but we appreciate the sentiment. Of the four things we ordered one of them came out incorrect which was odd being that two of items were supposed to be the same. The waiter bused the table with one not so swift movement while continuing to talk about himself. I wouldn't choose to go back.
1	"Great atmosphere, really good service, and plenty of good eating. We are staying in the hotel, came for dinner as we were tired and didn't feel like going somewhere else. We were quite surprised with the quality of the service and food. A+"
1	"Devine is marked by great food but even better service; the owner greeted us and took great care of us throughout our meal. Our party of four each ordered different meals and were each very happy with what we ate. The regular coffee is delicious, btw! Highly recommend!!!"
1	Absolutely amazing! The place is beautiful and staff are super friendly and the food is delicious. I have visited for lunch with my family. Ambience 5*  Quality 5*  Quantity 5*  Price 4*

1	Absolutely delicious food and an amazing experience! My first time and for sure wouldn’t be the last
1	Best food i have had this year - Really cannot express how much we enjoyed it..  Every dish was amazing with many layers of different flavour. service was amazing too. if you like good food you MUST go and eat here
1	The food is beautiful and the staff I advice to visit it nice place and delicious fooood really
1	"Vibrant atmosphere, warm service and delicious food."
1	"The most authentic Italian I’ve been to, servers were knowledgeable, professional but polite and fun. It’s definitely pricey not the sort of place to go for an affordable meal but if you want a special night out it’s perfect. Food was amazing you can really taste the quality."
1	First time been wanting to go for ages. Makes sure you have an appetite. I had pork knuckle. It would have fed 4 people. Lovely warm welcoming place will return. Seats a bit hard.
1	"The quality of the food in this restaurant is excellent. The service is top notch as well. The crab cakes are out of this world! The ambience is sort of dark and clubby. It is in a very convenient location in downtown Boston. Our service here left nothing to be desired. Good seafood is always expensive, but they somehow managed to keep the price within reason for such a delicious meal."
0	"I have felt like I have been discriminated at this location by the Cashier a young guy he ignored me and help 4 people behind the line but never bother even asking me why I am there. I hope some body in management reads this and try to train their employee some kind of consumer service. I just left without argument but that cashier was rude. If they discriminate you just because you don't look desirable for specific person then, I am sorry"
0	"Bad service as general, food poor and expensive."
1	"The best service I’ve had in Orlando, Will “The Waiter “ did the difference positively and the best the food was delicious!"
1	"The food is delicious and fresh with fresh bread and bakeries and some of the most delicious jams you can taste but that's not why I love this place. The service here is absolutely remarkable. We were constantly greeted by every staff person we came across in a pleasant and not an overwhelming way. Fresh bread was coming just as we needed it.  Refills for the small plates were offered as soon as we were done with any. It felt just like eating at home, if not slightly better."

0	Waited ages and not offered refills. Tea cold by the time mill arrived. 3 adults shared two Trays but they mixed up which tray I was sharing with so all very confusing. Two fingers of sandwiches and no additional offered. Only drink option for kids are fizzy.
1	Have a good experience lunch at Catappa Resto with cozy atmosphere and a very helpful employee is Dora.
0	Not worth the wait/queue. Food is average.
0	Went for dinner here tonight all I can say is don’t bother!!! Service was terrible and when our starters arrived I could only eat a small amount would not have served it myself!! We were waiting at least an hour for our main course so eventually we said we were leaving!! Very disappointing!!!!
1	Great restaurant at a beautiful location. The food was excellent and staff was very friendly! You should definitely pay a visit when you’re in stockholm!

1	"For my final night in town, I wanted to make sure that I had a great meal with some tasty beers. After seeing several recommendations and reviews, I decided that this would be the place to go. I am so happy that i did choose to come here as everything was excellent. I was also glad that I made a reservation ahead of time. My table was waiting for me when I arrived. I started the evening off with their 5 beer flight. You get their four beers plus the beer of the month. They all were so good. I also enjoyed a pretzel and three spreads with the beers. The dinner options all looked so good. But since I had not had schnitzel since I had been in Germany, I had to order it. It was so good! Besides having excellent beer and food, the staff was also so helpful and friendly. I look forward to coming back here again."
0	Ordered 2 lemon tarts and a draft muffin. The cakes were not fresh. Returned the cake and asked for a new cake. Also not very fresh and little understanding from the staff.
1	"I recommend to go here to eat the biggest (and best) cinnamon buns in town. They are great, but you have to go here early in the afternoon to get one. Otherwise they are sold out."
1	"Great ambiance, amazing food and excellent service. I always feel welcome coming here and Bruno does a great job at making sure you have a fantastic experience. They really go above and beyond. If you plan on going out to dinner for a date this is the perfect place. The setting is very romantic and is sure to impress. Also definitely order the thick cut bacon as an appetizer it is my favorite!"
1	Loved this place. The food was outstanding (schnitzel and pretzels) and the beer delicious. Served in a great atmosphere by excellent staff. We visited twice on our three night trip. Not to be missed.
0	"I had to wait for at least 25min for one single cappuccino to-go! Terrible service When it was my turn to order the waitress told me straight forward, that he had to go smoke a cigarette."
1	"Perfect food，perfect wine（they got a marvellous wine selection ), perfect staff and value for money!"
1	Very friendly and efficient lovely meal
1	"Went to Tranquilo for a lunch, costed me 120 Sek. At the table they had already placed some nice bread with soft cheese. Big plus. Ordered a feijoada and it was very good. Served with a lot of coriander. Got a small tasty salad too before the meal. Located near Saluhallen, so get a tram to Kungsportsplatsen or walk from Domkyrkan/Centralstationen. Nice view from the windows of you are lucky. Friendly staff."
0	"Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor."
1	"Very delicious and staff are very friendly! Loved this place. Keep in mind that you need to wait in line however, it is worth it!"
0	"I called the restaurant and i was told there is vacancy and tell me to come. When i arrived 30min later, the waitress told me its full and we have to wait for 30min. Terrible service"
1	This was probably our most favourite dinner that we had here in Amsterdam and it was so tasty. We arrived after 7pm and were lucky to get a table as the place was full. The staff were quick to take our order but were grumpy. The chicken jalfreezi was very flavourful as well as the onion barjis and cheese and garlic naan bread. Considering it was close to Centraal station it wasn't too badly priced. I would recommend coming here for an Indian when in Amsterdam.
0	"Unfriendly staff, mean portions, extremely unwelcoming to single women"

0	Horrible!!! The fried stuff was completely ice cold. Server was arrogant and acted like he didn’t want to serve us. Don’t go there!
1	"Absolutely fantastic buffet breakfast. The staff is extremely courteous and the menu is huge. I enjoyed the local and continental menu tremendously. They also have a huge selection of breads which are extremely soft and flavourful. If you love a hearty breakfast specially over a lazy weekend, give this place a try."
0	Missing an entire meal set except drink.
0	Cafe Tortoni is a grand old cafe that relies heavily on its fame rather than what they deliver. Disinterested staff and cold chewy churros did not make for a pleasant afternoon.

1	"Our meal was, without a doubt, the best steak dinner we have eaten in 44 years of marriage. Absolutely cooked to perfection. Our server was very attentive. "
1	"Amazing food in Paris. Very unique taste, enjoyed Pista Kufli. Entire staff was so nice.. will surely visit again"
1	"We went in not long after we arrived in Dublin and immediately were impressed. The staff, like most Dubliners, were engaging and witty. Food and drinks were promptly served and of fine quality and good value."
0	I wouldn’t recommend unless you want sushi that’s taste like burger sauce.
1	een here a couple of times with friends and in a couple. The food is out of this world- would recommend the ceviche as the flavours are unbeatable.
1	After hearing and reading the reviews I decided to go one night and by far was the best night it has great drinks it has great food and most of all it's a great bartender
0	It disappointed me for that high rate and recommendations. The food is very average or low. The price is high for this average taste and food.
0	Honestly the worst Masala sauce I have ever tasted - very sweet and full of coconut . Even the waiter said it was not how he would cook it . The pickles /yoghurt with poppadoms were also sweet and not very nice . The service was good however and they did take both currys off the bill.
0	I had the lunch menu and it was clearly not great. The burrata starter was the best but followed by a lousy US prime and a very mediocre apple tart...
1	The food is very good and the staff were friendly. They can make very small changes the light in the place to improve the ambient. I felt like I was having a meal in a football stadium.
0	"I understand that it’s Christmas and people want to go home, or would rather not be at work. This is utterly ridiculous. Don’t order seasonal pancakes, you’ll get plain ones and they won’t even give you syrup, my kids meal came with 4 spoonfuls of Mac and cheese, nothing else, for $7.30, we ordered fries, got onion rings. That is blatant disregard for the consumer."
0	"The workers do not pay much attention to you, and worse! We been asked to leave the place while still having our food + coffees!!!"
1	"Wonderful spanish tapas. Unique flavors! I certainly will eat again in that foodtruck! the best in Sweden!!! 100% recommendable. Also if you want to celebrate an event at home, call them! Very professional!"
0	The food was below average
1	"Came with my friends for drinks and snacks was so good. Also best friendly staffs casimiro, zyane.. Amazing yummy food by excellent chef and view was great.. Would like to recommend with friends to hangout.."
0	"Hi,I went to this place because Tayyabs was jampacked and this place had an overall good rating. However, it was a bad decision. The service was average, not too prompt, but not too slow either. The ambience was ok, the place was clean. However, any restaurant is only as good as its food.First off, we ordered a Tandoori Platter: miniscule portions (though this was supposed to be sufficient for 2 people), taste was just ok. Hardly any salt in it though: how can u have Tandoori with no salt, Blood Pressure be damned!Next: Chicken Vindaloo and Garlic Naan for me: Portion was just sufficient. Vindaloo was bad, plain bad.... oily, barely any spices other than chillies and again, no salt! :) Nan was okMughlai Chicken Biryani for my partner: The Mughal cooks would be turning in their graves if they came to know what is being passed on as Biriyani here. It was awful.... just awful. It tasted like some sorry attempt at a stir fry. I wonder what the other reviewers will say if they ever go to South Asia and taste an actual authentic Biriyani! Really, such restaurants are a disgrace to the food they claim to serve!Anyways, this was my first and last visit to this restaurant and hopefully Brick Lane. Please avoid at all costs. Take the effort to cook up something by reading from a website, or take some Ready to Eat meal from M&S or Tesco, which I am sure will taste much, much better."
1	Such a great place for an authentic Turkish breakfast. The servants are nice and welcoming and the food tastes amazing. The price is crazy and I would therefore not recommend this for you if you were looking for cheaper breakfast (because there is much cheaper bus as good as this). The place is adorable and the atmosphere is the best. They say the food is organic.
0	The food wasn’t that good. The waiter Mr. Kay was very intrusive. He made our friend write a review on trip advisor and checked it. We were running late and we made that clear but he kept delaying us. Don’t advise that place at all.
0	"Not my first visit to a red lobster, but felt the need to review just because the service was not very good this day. We were sat down quickly when we got in and the order was placed fairly quick. But after that, it easily took 30-40 mins to get our order of tacos and a kids meal. Not very efficient and not what i am used to from Red Lobster."
1	Lunch buffet:Fantastic food and service! Excellent price also :) :)Food all eaten up and great coffee to boot!!
1	"Delicious baked goods, I look forward to stopping by each week to grab a loaf of their delicious sourdough and an assortment of pastries. The ugly bits change flavors but always deliver. Staff are friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"
1	"This Thai restaurant is amazing! The food and atmosphere takes you away to Asia! The food was superb, the service was friendly and fast, the location is right off the Avenue. I liked the peanut sauce chicken best."
0	Food was average. Service was cold . The restaurant is more focused on European crowd. Not a great place for Indian taste buds
1	"Great destination for a day trip, take a ride, get out of the house, go to Alice's. You won't be disappointed! Burgers were good and the brisket sandwich was fantastic! Beer was cold as was the ice in the water... Had a great time with some good food."
1	After eating pastries every morning at many locales it is true - these are the best!
1	Lovely staff and so kind to our dog!
0	Ordered Pad se eww. Food was extremely bland. Ordered their spiciest level and the food was not spicy. Asked them to seperate appetizer and main course and they brought us everything at the same time. Pad se eww is bad. Tom yum soup is decent. Calamari was not crunchy. The FBI was good. Thai tea was good.
1	Really authentic polish restaurant. The dumplings and soup are so tasty. The decoration is extravagant.
1	"We showed up 30 minutes before closing. Not only was the service amazing...,,,but the food was exceptional!!! The Pho was delicious and the complimentary desert was  a perfect ending to an amazing meal!!!"
0	"We visited on Christmas eve and waved to 3 different staff and didn't get an attention to order. When the lady finally came, she rudely asked me to ""have some patience as it is Christmas"". As a frequent traveller, I think a more apt statement from a service staff should have been ""sorry we took so long to get to you!"" if not for the fact I didn't want to hunt around for another place to eat on xmas, I would have walked out. Food is good but dining experience scarred by the staff =/"
0	"The food was average, at best. In all my years, this was the 'sweetest' butter chicken I have been served... 
0	"Over all I felt a bit disappointing with above reasons. I’d didn’t feel like an occasion dining out, just nice dining out experience"
