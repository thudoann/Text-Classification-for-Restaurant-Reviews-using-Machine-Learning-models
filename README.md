# Text-Classification-for-Restaurant-Reviews-using-Machine-Learning-models


The data we used in this project were be annotated collectively by all participants in the course.

* Calculated the percentage of misannotated reviews led to a difference in the annotations between the annotators. 
* Used sentiment analysis on the rows with annotation disagreement.
* Chose the baseline classifier based on the most-frequent class in the training dataset.
* Created machine pipeline to evaluate the performance of several models and tuned hyperparameter on the highest accuracy model (SVC)
* Evaluated the model (with model's accuracy, confusion matrix, precision and recall table)
* Feature importance and model interpretability
