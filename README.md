# Text-Classification-for-Restaurant-Reviews-using-Machine-Learning-models


The data we used in this project were be annotated collectively by all participants in the course.

* We used TF-IDF vectorizer to preprocess the text data
* Chose the baseline classifier based on the most-frequent class in the training dataset
* Tuned hyperparameter on the chosen model (SVC)
* Evaluated the model (with model's accuracy, confusion matrix, precision and recall table)
* Feature importance and model interpretability
